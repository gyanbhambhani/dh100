No, you’re crazy for keeping them in!\n\nI was relieved when the city announced schools were shuttering on March 15, so I didn’t have to decide.\n\nSince that night, the other decisions I have made as a mother came rushing back — the ones I have been judged for getting wrong, either overtly or through brightly exclaimed, passive-aggressive jabs like, “Well, whatever works for you!” These are the kinds of choices that as a well-resourced white woman living in a big city, I am supposed to agonize over: Does that chicken really need to be organic?

Bush administration, homeland security and health officials focused on big gaps in the American response to a biological attacks and the growing risk of pandemics. The first test came in April 2009, just a few months after the start of President Barack Obama’s first term. A 10-year-old California girl was diagnosed with a contagious disease that would be called swine flu or H1N1, the first flu pandemic in more than 40 years.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that ultimately there were about 60.8 million cases in the United States, along with 274,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths associated with H1N1.\n\nThe virus turned out to be less deadly than first expected.

It’s new, so few people have immunity. It causes infection without symptoms in some people, who can unknowingly infect others. And it can latch on to receptors in the lung, causing severe pneumonia much more frequently (perhaps 10 times more) than seasonal flu.\n\nDespite common perceptions, it’s not just the elderly and frail who are at significant risk of a life-threatening complication. Data from China suggest that many chronic health problems increase the likelihood of a bad outcome, including cardiovascular disease, which affects nearly half the adults in the United States in some form, and diabetes, which affects about 10 percent. In Italy, 99 percent of the fatalities were people with pre-existing medical problems, especially hypertension.\n\nMoreover, in the United States, obesity-related metabolic conditions may put the public at exceptional risk. Today, more than two of three adults have high body weight, and 42 percent have obesity, among the highest rates in the world. Almost two in 10 children have obesity. Excessive weight, and the poor-quality diet that causes it, is strongly associated with insulin resistance, chronic inflammation and other abnormalities that may lower immunity to viral respiratory infection or predispose to complications.\n\nIn a California study of the 2009 influenza pandemic, people with obesity were twice as likely to be hospitalized compared with the state population. Among those who were hospitalized, the risk of dying was significantly increased for people with severe obesity. A small study conducted in 2013 of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), caused by another coronavirus, reported a similar relationship.\n\nWe don’t know yet whether these preliminary findings will apply to Covid-19. However, the high prevalence of obesity-related chronic disease at all ages raises serious concern. Only 12 percent of Americans over age 20 are considered metabolically healthy — that is, with optimal measures for waist circumference, blood sugar, blood pressure and lipids, and not taking drugs to control these risk factors.

In April, supposedly, it dies with the hotter weather. This virus is probably with us beyond this season, or beyond this year. This is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. Have you been briefed by the CDC? I have. Are there words about a pandemic at this point? No, not at all, and we have it totally under control. When you have 15 people and the 15, within a couple of days, is going to be down to close to zero. And we can expect to see more cases in the United States. We will see more cases. Unfortunately, we are likely to see more deaths. I like the numbers being where they are. I don’t need to have the numbers double. We’ll certainly have tens of thousands of cases in the US. Hopefully, we won’t hit hundreds of thousands of cases. We’d much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it, and that’s what we are. You are always behind where you think you are. If you think you’re here, you’re really here. Anybody that wants a test can get a test. Not everybody, tomorrow, is going to be able to get a test. Anybody that needs a test. That’s the important thing. And the tests are all perfect. The idea of anybody getting it easily, the way people in other country are doing it, we’re not set up for that. That is a failing. A failing? Yes. It is a failing, let’s admit it.

Yesterday was approximately six and a half years ago. For writers, as the tentacles of the coronavirus unfurl each day, everything is copy. But what happens when every writer on the planet starts taking notes on the same subject? Will we all hand in our book reports simultaneously, a year from now? The nature of tragedy is that it takes more than it gives, but it’s also produced some of our most iconic literature. The Great Depression brought “The Grapes of Wrath.” The Spanish Inquisition helped inspire “Don Quixote.” Cholera gave Camus “The Plague” (so to speak). Shakespeare, Twitter has been quick to remind us, wrote under quarantine. There’s something comfortingly glib about art-shaming in the midst of being told you’re a vector for death. The Accidental Murderer: And Other Stories.\n\nFrom an artistic standpoint, it’s best to let tragedy cool before gulping it down and spitting it back into everyone’s faces. After all, “Don Quixote” was published about a century into the Spanish Inquisition. Art should be given a metaphorical berth as wide as the literal one we’re giving one another. Right now we are distracted and anxious beyond measure, but things will settle (how much and when remains to be seen), and then?

They have not aged well. Really, we’re only just now nailing World War I. But like everyone else, writers feel the need to distill life as a means of surviving it.\n\nOur particular era strikes me as especially susceptible to this impulse. Part of the reason is that our response to disaster (terrorist attacks, hurricanes, school shootings) is to get out there and declare the death of irony. Like Steve Carell’s character on “The Office,” who declares bankruptcy by screaming, “I declare bankruptcy!,” you can’t just cry sincerity because you want a shortcut to perspective or because you want to keep your jokes inoffensive. When the coronavirus has passed, we will say, sincerely, perhaps for the first time in our lives, Our long national nightmare is over. But this will not be our final use of the phrase.

A medical V-Day, where V meant both vaccine and victory, over a feared and previously deadly enemy.\n\nFor most of us alive now, it’s a new experience to be longing for a vaccine. The success of the Ebola vaccine (approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2019) was a great and speedy achievement, but I’m not sure that the general public in the United States was profoundly aware of it, or profoundly relieved. And the vaccines that have been added into the schedule in recent years work wonderfully, but it’s not clear that people were living in fear, waiting and hoping for an HPV vaccine, or even a meningitis vaccine. One vaccine that many people wished for urgently — but that never arrived — was an H.I.V. vaccine, which is still not close.\n\nYes, there was powerful advocacy by people whose children’s lives had been destroyed by meningitis (the so-called meningitis vaccine actually specifically works against one very particular bacteria, Neisseria meningitidis, so named for its propensity to cause meningitis).

According to one legend, rain washed the fat and ash from frequent animal sacrifices into a nearby river, where they formed a lather with a remarkable ability to clean skin and clothes. Perhaps the inspiration had a vegetal origin in the frothy solutions produced by boiling or mashing certain plants. However it happened, the ancient discovery of soap altered human history. Although our ancestors could not have foreseen it, soap would ultimately become one of our most effective defenses against invisible pathogens.\n\nPeople typically think of soap as gentle and soothing, but from the perspective of microorganisms, it is often extremely destructive. A drop of ordinary soap diluted in water is sufficient to rupture and kill many types of bacteria and viruses, including the new coronavirus that is currently circling the globe. The secret to soap’s impressive might is its hybrid structure.\n\nSoap is made of pin-shaped molecules, each of which has a hydrophilic head — it readily bonds with water — and a hydrophobic tail, which shuns water and prefers to link up with oils and fats. These molecules, when suspended in water, alternately float about as solitary units, interact with other molecules in the solution and assemble themselves into little bubbles called micelles, with heads pointing outward and tails tucked inside.\n\nSome bacteria and viruses have lipid membranes that resemble double-layered micelles with two bands of hydrophobic tails sandwiched between two rings of hydrophilic heads. These membranes are studded with important proteins that allow viruses to infect cells and perform vital tasks that keep bacteria alive. Pathogens wrapped in lipid membranes include coronaviruses, H.I.V., the viruses that cause hepatitis B and C, herpes, Ebola, Zika, dengue, and numerous bacteria that attack the intestines and respiratory tract.", "location": ["Oregon", "Indiana"], "gpt_analysis": {"tone": "neutral", "framing": "preventable", "group_mentions": [], "metaphors": ["war", "fight"], "euphemisms": [], "absences": ["elderly", "racial minorities", "working-class", "disabled", "children", "incarcerated people", "undocumented immigrants", "poverty", "racism", "elder neglect", "long COVID", "workplace safety", "healthcare access"], "grief_handling": "absent", "blame_or_agency": "The article suggests that the deaths are preventable through proper hygiene practices, implying agency lies with individuals and public health measures.", "commodification_of_death": "The article does not commodify death; it focuses on the scientific explanation of soap\'s effectiveness."}}, {"headline": "10 Ways to Ease Your Coronavirus Anxiety", "source": "The New York Times", "publish_date": "Mar 27, 2020", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/smarter-living/coronavirus-anxiety-tips.html", "article_text": "Don’t be afraid to ask for help.\n\nNow is the time to turn toward each other. “We are here to help each other out,” Dr. Lerner reminds us, “so avoid being a do-it-yourselfer when you’re not qualified. Grab some other clear-thinking person to ask what she thinks or what he would do about stockpiling food, or taking that plane trip, or talking to little Billy about what’s going on with grandma in the hospital and his school being closed. You may choose not to follow the advice you seek, but it’s essential to have other perspectives.”\n\nDon’t procrastinate about preparing for the worst.\n\nAnxiety, Dr. Lerner says, can push us to under- or overreact: “So we either engage in compulsive hand washing or we do the opposite and act like the germ theory doesn’t apply to us.” And this anxiety, she says, will mount if we postpone or ignore expert counsel: “Passivity and inaction will make fear grow.” So, instead of giving up and saying, “I can’t keep my hands off my face,” Dr. Lerner suggests we trust our capacity to make necessary changes, recognize where we have agency and take common sense, precautionary measures now. “If you haven’t done your best to get a couple of extra weeks’ supply of food or medication, do it today. If you feel frozen, ask a buddy to push you to act and help you make wise decisions about how much you need of what.”\n\nConnect, connect, connect.\n\nSocial distancing and mandates to shelter in place may require us to stay in our homes, but that doesn’t mean we have to isolate. “It’s essential to stay in communication with family, friends, neighbors and other resources,” Dr. Lerner says, “and find ways to keep calm. Use the phone, text, email — all means possible — to stay connected to friends, neighbors, your adult children, anyone who matters to you. Especially those who induce a sense of calm rather than chaos. People need to hear your voice — and vice versa.”\n\nPractice self-compassion.\n\nThis moment calls on us to not only care for others but to also be gentle with ourselves. “Anxiety and fear,” Dr. Lerner reminds us, “are physiological processes that cavort and careen through our bodies and make us miserable. They will subside, only to return again; they will arrive uninvited for as long as we live. So don’t be hard on yourself when you can’t shut yourself off from fear and pain — your own and the world’s. Fear isn’t fun, but it signals that we are fully human.”\n\nDon’t skip the self-care.\n\n“Everything that goes under the umbrella of ‘self-care’ is essential right now,” Dr. Lerner says.

But there can never be safety — and that is why, for Camus, we need to love our fellow damned humans and work without hope or despair for the amelioration of suffering. Life is a hospice, never a hospital.\n\nAt the height of the contagion, when 500 people a week are dying, a Catholic priest called Paneloux gives a sermon that explains the plague as God’s punishment for depravity. But Dr. Rieux has watched a child die and knows better: Suffering is randomly distributed, it makes no sense, it is simply absurd, and that is the kindest thing one can say of it.\n\nThe doctor works tirelessly to lessen the suffering of those around him. But he is no hero. “This whole thing is not about heroism,” Dr. Rieux says. “It may seem a ridiculous idea, but the only way to fight the plague is with decency.” Another character asks what decency is. “Doing my job,” the doctor replies.\n\nEventually, after more than a year, the plague ebbs away. The townspeople celebrate. Suffering is over. Normality can return. But Dr. Rieux “knew that this chronicle could not be a story of definitive victory,” Camus writes. “It could only be the record of what had to be done and what, no doubt, would have to be done again, against this terror.” The plague, he continues, “never dies”; it “waits patiently in bedrooms, cellars, trunks, handkerchiefs and old papers” for the day when it will once again “rouse its rats and send them to die in some well-contented city.”\n\nCamus speaks to us in our own times not because he was a magical seer who could intimate what the best epidemiologists could not, but because he correctly sized up human nature. He knew, as we do not, that “everyone has it inside himself, this plague, because no one in the world, no one, is immune.”\n\nAlain de Botton is the author, most recently, of “The School of Life.”\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

At least six other types of coronavirus are known to infect humans, with some causing the common cold and two causing outbreaks: SARS and MERS.\n\nSpike\n\nproteins Proteins\n\nand lipids\n\nCovered With Spikes\n\nThe coronavirus is named after the crownlike spikes that protrude from its surface. The virus is enveloped in a bubble of oily lipid molecules, which falls apart on contact with soap.\n\nACE2\n\nEntering a Vulnerable Cell\n\nThe virus enters the body through the nose, mouth or eyes, then attaches to cells in the airway that produce a protein called ACE2. The virus is believed to have originated in bats, where it may have attached to a similar protein.\n\nProtective\n\nwrapping Viral RNA\n\nReleasing Viral RNA\n\nThe virus infects the cell by fusing its oily membrane with the membrane of the cell. Once inside, the coronavirus releases a snippet of genetic material called RNA.\n\nViral protein Viral RNA\n\nHijacking the Cell\n\nThe virus’s genome is less than 30,000 genetic “letters” long. (Ours is over 3 billion.) The infected cell reads the RNA and begins making proteins that will keep the immune system at bay and help assemble new copies of the virus.\n\nAntibiotics kill bacteria and do not work against viruses. But researchers are testing antiviral drugs that might disrupt viral proteins and stop the infection.\n\nCell nucleus Viral proteins\n\nMaking Viral Proteins\n\nAs the infection progresses, the machinery of the cell begins to churn out new spikes and other proteins that will form more copies of the coronavirus.\n\nAssembling New Copies\n\nNew copies of the virus are assembled and carried to the outer edges of the cell.\n\nSpreading the Infection\n\nEach infected cell can release millions of copies of the virus before the cell finally breaks down and dies. The viruses may infect nearby cells, or end up in droplets that escape the lungs.\n\nDebris from\n\ndead cells\n\nImmune Response\n\nMost Covid-19 infections cause a fever as the immune system fights to clear the virus. In severe cases, the immune system can overreact and start attacking lung cells. The lungs become obstructed with fluid and dying cells, making it difficult to breathe. A small percentage of infections can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and possibly death.\n\nLeaving the Body\n\nCoughing and sneezing can expel virus-laden droplets onto nearby people and surfaces, where the virus can remain infectious for several hours to several days. The C.D.C. recommends that people diagnosed with Covid-19 wear masks to reduce the release of viruses. Health care workers and others who care for infected people should wear masks, too.\n\nFlu vaccine Flu antibody Potential\n\ncoronavirus\n\nvaccine Antibodies\n\ntargeting\n\nviruses\n\nA Possible Vaccine\n\nA future vaccine could help the body produce antibodies that target the SARS-CoV-2 virus and prevent it from infecting human cells. The flu vaccine works in a similar way, but antibodies generated from a flu vaccine do not protect against coronavirus.\n\nHow Soap Works\n\nSoap destroys the virus when the water-shunning tails of the soap molecules wedge themselves into the lipid membrane and pry it apart.\n\nThe best way to avoid getting infected with the coronavirus is to wash your hands with soap, avoid touching your face, keep your distance from sick people and regularly clean frequently used surfaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources: Dr. Matthew B.

This is because unlike the 2009 swine flu outbreak, when children were prioritized for vaccine because they were most susceptible, with Covid-19 older patients and those with serious health conditions have an elevated risk of dying.\n\nTo maximize the benefits of a vaccine for society, those most likely to die or to utilize large amounts of scarce resources if they become infected should be given the vaccine first. This should be modified, if it turns out children do not fall ill, but are a major source of coronavirus transmission. Giving children priority for vaccines would then be justified because it would help save others.\n\nFinally, when a vaccine is produced, there will initially be severe shortages. With 50 million Americans over age 65, 16 million who have emphysema, five million with heart failure and 30 million with diabetes, initially there will be more people who need the vaccine than can get it. Whom to choose? In this case, after vaccinating frontline health workers and other first responders, equality suggests a random selection, such as a lottery, among those in the highest risk category of dying from coronavirus.\n\nRationing lifesaving interventions is horrendously wrenching. No one wants to choose which patient gets a ventilator or vaccine, and which patient may die because he or she does not. For doctors and nurses this presents the specter of abandoning patients. It readily leads to burnout — and therefore less effective care. For patients and families, the denial of potentially lifesaving treatment generates feelings of disempowerment, being discarded and having one’s one’s worth denied. Some will erupt in anger.

There were few novels or films chronicling the experience then, and there have been few since. Most newspapers and radio stations were slow to report on it.\n\n“It’s really weird,” said Nancy K.

And yet, looking back, Frederick Trump’s death was a signature of that pandemic, which not only hit both the young and the old, but also many people like him, seemingly in their prime, healthy middle years.\n\nIt hit his son Fred — Donald Trump’s father — especially hard. It was “so immediate, he couldn’t take it in,” said Gwenda Blair, an adjunct professor at Columbia University and the author of “The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a President.” Ms. Blair interviewed Fred Trump about his father’s passing in 1991. She was among the few biographers to have had access to the family and to have investigated their genealogical history. “He was very matter of fact about it,” she said.\n\n“It just didn’t seem real,” Fred Trump told her. “‘I wasn’t that upset. You know how kids are. But I got upset watching my mother crying and being so sad.

How many Americans can become infected? How many might die?\n\nThe answers depend on the actions we take — and, crucially, on when we take them. Working with infectious disease epidemiologists, we developed this interactive tool that lets you see what may lie ahead in the United States and how much of a difference it could make if officials act quickly. (The figures are for America, but the lessons are broadly applicable to any country.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we stay on the current track, this model predicts that roughly a third of Americans – more than 100 million people — could become infected (including more than nine million at one time). Other estimates are higher, up to two-thirds, but even in this scenario, one million could die. But interventions matter hugely. Ending public gatherings, closing workplaces and some schools, mass testing and fortifying hospitals keep infection rates down and reduce deaths. Here’s that same scenario but shifted so that the interventions begin one month later. The number of infections climbs by more than two million. So it’s not just intervening that’s important — it’s intervening quickly. Yesterday is better than today, which is better than tomorrow. Try it yourself by dragging the intervention bar on the chartslider below to the left or right to change when interventions are put in place. Adjust intervention start date: Aggressiveness matters, too. Adjust the severity of the interventions below to see why: Aggressive measures include widespread testing and ending large gatherings, while mild measures are essentially the status quo (although some places are instituting tougher measures). What matters is not only the total number of infections but also whether many occur at once. Overloaded hospitals and shortages of ventilators in intensive care units would result in people dying unnecessarily from the coronavirus as well as from heart attacks and other ailments. So successful interventions are crucial because they flatten the curve: We are much better off if the 100 million infections occur over 18 months rather than over 18 weeks. Here’s the same number of I.C.U. cases as before, but modeled to occur at a much slower rate.\n\nAny disease model is only as good as the assumptions programmed into it, and there’s so much uncertainty about the coronavirus that we shouldn’t see this model as a precise prediction.\n\nOne fundamental unknown is whether warmer weather will help reduce infections, as happens with the seasonal flu. If so, we could see a respite this summer, and then a resumption of cases in the fall (that’s what happened in 1918 with the Spanish flu pandemic). In addition, there are a number of treatments that are being tested and may prove helpful against the coronavirus.\n\n[For more analysis of global events that affect your life and a behind-the-scenes look at Nick Kristof\'s journalism, sign up for his newsletter.]\n\nOn the other hand, shortages of protective equipment like masks and chaos in hospitals may lead to higher death rates; the United States also has an older and thus more vulnerable population than China, from which much of the data comes.\n\n“The point of a model like this is not to try to predict the future but to help people understand why we may need to change our behaviors or restrict our movements, and also to give people a sense of the sort of effect these changes can have,” said Ashleigh Tuite, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto who helped us develop this model. “When we have a new disease introduced in a population, we don’t have the benefit of immunity or vaccines to limit spread, but that doesn’t mean that we can’t control it,” she added. “Other countries have already shown that a strong response can bend the epidemic curve.”\n\nPresident Trump announced some steps on Wednesday to address the coronavirus, but they focused on the economy and on sharply reducing travel from most of Europe. At this point we may already have tens of thousands of infections in the United States — no one knows, because testing has been catastrophically bungled — and the number of cases is probably doubling every six days or so. In these circumstances, stopping a few new cases from Europe may not matter so much.\n\nPublic health specialists say we need a huge expansion of testing, major curbs on public gatherings, suspension of school in affected areas and intensive preparations so that hospitals can still function as infections soar. (We’ve recommended these and other crucial steps here).\n\nDavid N. Fisman, another University of Toronto epidemiologist who helped us assemble this model, noted that the challenge is that aggressive interventions must be put in place early to be most effective — and yet early in an epidemic the public may not be concerned enough to embrace such measures.\n\n“Early in the epidemic it is very difficult to muster the political will to implement costly, disruptive disease-control policies,” Dr. Fisman said. “What we are hoping to show here is that the calculus is one of short-term pain for long-term gain: Early, aggressive social distancing can substantially reduce the toll of epidemics, which can include the near collapse of health care systems, as we’re currently seeing in Italy.”\n\nWe’ll be honest: We worried that the clean lines in the graphics here risk suggesting a false precision. None of us know what lies ahead. But the wise uncertainty of epidemiologists is preferable to the confident bluster of television blowhards. The one thing we can be confident of is that enormous risks lie ahead — including a huge loss of life — if we don’t take aggressive action.\n\nWe have already squandered weeks in which the president scoffed at the coronavirus and tried to talk up the stock markets, but it’s not too late: We can still change the course of this epidemic.", "location": ["Oregon", "China", "America", "Europe", "The United States", "Italy", "Indiana"], "gpt_analysis": {"tone": "urgent", "framing": "preventable", "group_mentions": ["elderly", "public health specialists", "infectious disease epidemiologists", "older population"], "metaphors": ["flatten the curve", "bend the epidemic curve", "short-term pain for long-term gain"], "euphemisms": [], "absences": ["racial minorities", "working-class", "disabled", "children", "incarcerated people", "undocumented immigrants", "poverty", "racism", "healthcare access"], "grief_handling": "absent", "blame_or_agency": "The article assigns responsibility to government officials and the public for not taking aggressive action sooner.

Just last week (which feels like a hundred years ago), a friend suggested that there may be a sort of Freudian transference from coronavirus to climate — that the fear and sense of urgency will be lifted from the faster-moving crisis and settle on the slower one, becoming a catalyst for much-needed action. So far, it seems any transference is working in the opposite direction: Lockdowns and social distancing are providing a litany of necessary actions ripe for the transferal of nebulous climate anxieties and fears. In this context, consumerism perversely provides some relief — you can finally go buy dry goods to prepare for the apocalypse.\n\nBut personal consumption and travel habits are, in fact, changing, which has some people wondering if this might be the beginning of a meaningful shift. Maybe, as you hunker down with cabinets full of essentials, your sense of what consumer goods you need will shrink. Maybe, even after the acute phase of the coronavirus crisis has passed, you will be more likely to telecommute.

Maybe among the relatively wealthy, jumping on a plane for a weekend away or for a destination wedding will come to seem unthinkable.\n\nSweeping changes in individual habits — particularly in wealthy countries with high per capita consumption — could lead to lower emissions, which would be an unequivocal good. But personal habits may matter less because of direct reductions in carbon emissions and more because of “behavioral contagion,” a term from the social sciences that refers to the way ideas and behaviors spread through a population and can, in terms of climate action, lead to changes in voting and even policy.\n\nWhich is to say, in order to be meaningful for global emissions, changes in consumption habits as a result of the virus would need to extend beyond individuals to the larger structures that shape our lives. In China, it wasn’t telecommuting or grounded planes that led to the 25 percent drop in emissions. It was the abrupt halt of industrial manufacturing. (The concept of the “personal carbon footprint” was popularized by BP in a 2005 media campaign costing over $100 million — a campaign that, research has indicated, deflected responsibility for climate change away from the corporation and onto the individual consumer.) This is not to say that personal consumption is meaningless — a significant reduction in air travel could decrease aviation emissions. But aviation accounts for only about 2.5 percent of global emissions, an amount that looks downright puny in the shadow cast by heavy industry.\n\nIf anything, the short-term positive effects on the climate that we’re seeing today serve as a dramatic reminder that changing personal consumption habits will mean very little going forward if we also fail to decarbonize the global economy.", "location": ["Oregon", "Indiana", "China"], "gpt_analysis": {"tone": "neutral", "framing": "systemic injustice", "group_mentions": ["relatively wealthy", "individual consumers"], "metaphors": ["apocalypse", "behavioral contagion", "shadow cast by heavy industry"], "euphemisms": [], "absences": ["COVID-19 deaths", "healthcare access", "elderly", "racial minorities", "working-class", "disabled", "children", "incarcerated people", "undocumented immigrants", "poverty", "racism", "elder neglect", "long COVID", "workplace safety"], "grief_handling": "absent", "blame_or_agency": "The article suggests that responsibility for climate change and by extension, the systemic issues highlighted by COVID-19, lies with larger structures and corporations rather than individuals.", "commodification_of_death": "COVID-19 is used as a political talking point to discuss climate change, but death itself is not directly addressed or commodified."}}, {"headline": "The President vs. the Experts: How Trump Played Down ...", "source": "The New York Times", "publish_date": "Mar 18, 2020", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/18/us/trump-coronavirus-statements-timeline.html", "article_text": "Even as the number of cases rose to 60, Mr. Trump said at a news conference that infections were declining. “We’re going down, not up.

At least six other types of coronavirus are known to infect humans, with some causing the common cold and two causing outbreaks: SARS and MERS.\n\nSpike\n\nproteins Proteins\n\nand lipids\n\nCovered With Spikes\n\nThe coronavirus is named after the crownlike spikes that protrude from its surface. The virus is enveloped in a bubble of oily lipid molecules, which falls apart on contact with soap.\n\nACE2\n\nEntering a Vulnerable Cell\n\nThe virus enters the body through the nose, mouth or eyes, then attaches to cells in the airway that produce a protein called ACE2. The virus is believed to have originated in bats, where it may have attached to a similar protein.\n\nProtective\n\nwrapping Viral RNA\n\nReleasing Viral RNA\n\nThe virus infects the cell by fusing its oily membrane with the membrane of the cell. Once inside, the coronavirus releases a snippet of genetic material called RNA.\n\nViral protein Viral RNA\n\nHijacking the Cell\n\nThe virus’s genome is less than 30,000 genetic “letters” long. (Ours is over 3 billion.) The infected cell reads the RNA and begins making proteins that will keep the immune system at bay and help assemble new copies of the virus.\n\nAntibiotics kill bacteria and do not work against viruses. But researchers are testing antiviral drugs that might disrupt viral proteins and stop the infection.\n\nCell nucleus Viral proteins\n\nMaking Viral Proteins\n\nAs the infection progresses, the machinery of the cell begins to churn out new spikes and other proteins that will form more copies of the coronavirus.\n\nAssembling New Copies\n\nNew copies of the virus are assembled and carried to the outer edges of the cell.\n\nSpreading the Infection\n\nEach infected cell can release millions of copies of the virus before the cell finally breaks down and dies. The viruses may infect nearby cells, or end up in droplets that escape the lungs.\n\nDebris from\n\ndead cells\n\nImmune Response\n\nMost Covid-19 infections cause a fever as the immune system fights to clear the virus. In severe cases, the immune system can overreact and start attacking lung cells. The lungs become obstructed with fluid and dying cells, making it difficult to breathe. A small percentage of infections can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and possibly death.\n\nLeaving the Body\n\nCoughing and sneezing can expel virus-laden droplets onto nearby people and surfaces, where the virus can remain infectious for several hours to several days. The C.D.C. recommends that people diagnosed with Covid-19 wear masks to reduce the release of viruses. Health care workers and others who care for infected people should wear masks, too.\n\nFlu vaccine Flu antibody Potential\n\ncoronavirus\n\nvaccine Antibodies\n\ntargeting\n\nviruses\n\nA Possible Vaccine\n\nA future vaccine could help the body produce antibodies that target the SARS-CoV-2 virus and prevent it from infecting human cells. The flu vaccine works in a similar way, but antibodies generated from a flu vaccine do not protect against coronavirus.\n\nHow Soap Works\n\nSoap destroys the virus when the water-shunning tails of the soap molecules wedge themselves into the lipid membrane and pry it apart.\n\nThe best way to avoid getting infected with the coronavirus is to wash your hands with soap, avoid touching your face, keep your distance from sick people and regularly clean frequently used surfaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources: Dr. Matthew B.

Getting away from shaking hands is a good thing. Maybe people shouldn’t be shaking hands for the long term because it does transmit flu and other things. I’m working on getting the boss to do this. I may not be successful, but we’re working on it. In terms of deaths, I don’t what the count is today. Is it 11? 11 people. What is the number as of this morning? Is it 32? You could tell me, is it 32 deaths, Steve? Unfortunately, one person passed away overnight. She was a wonderful woman, a medically high-risk patient in her late 50s.

Even before Covid-19, it was a struggle for people to act as if his life was still worth protecting. They speak about him in the past tense, using language like “no quality of life.” The term “useless eater” hangs just beyond what’s said aloud. I am terrified of how Covid-19 will hit him, and everyone I care for with dementia in my hospice program.\n\nAs a disabled, Jewish, second-generation Holocaust survivor, the words “useless eater” are practically in my DNA. I can taste the tang of them in my mouth as I read the news, in the bitterness of Italy’s policies, in this country’s callous health care, in affluent people refusing to listen to sick and disabled voices and stay home when they can afford to, in the dismissive internet comments that only the sick and old need to worry, so who cares?\n\nMy cells remember other things, too. That to survive illness and trauma, whether individual or communal, we need one another, including strangers. When my father was two years old, hiding from Nazis in a Christian foster home, he developed a loud case of whooping cough. He was dropped unceremoniously at the doors of a Belgian nunnery. These women nursed him back to health, and returned him a few months later, fully recovered. I wish I knew their names. These faceless women to whom I owe my existence, who cared for him, bathed him, changed him, powdered him.\n\nIn this moment, one of the best ways you can show up and save the lives of fellow human beings is by withdrawing physically. Staying away from other people contradicts our image of what saving lives looks like. We are used to heroes rushing in. But disabled and sick people already know that stillness can be caring. We know that immune systems are fragile things, and homes can’t always be left. Rest is disability justice, and right now it is one of our most powerful tools to keep one another alive.\n\nI have spent years of my life rarely leaving home. Being stuck at home due to illness often sucks, but sometimes it is other things, too. Calm. The kinds of connection that can only come from profound slowness, from borrowing down instead of stretching out. Even as we withdraw physically, our emotional and spiritual need for others has never been more visible. I already knew that we needed one another in intimate ways that go beyond the capacity of our bodies to connect. Disabled people are experts in deep, luscious intimacy without touch. We are used to being creative. As the Disability Justice performance project Sins Invalid says, “We love like barnacles,” sticking to one another wherever, and however we can.\n\nJewish mysticism holds that the letters of a Torah scroll are black fire on the white fire of the parchment. In this moment, we must find a way to make the spaces between us holy.

Put simply, the idea is to maintain a distance between you and other people — in this case, at least six feet. That also means minimizing contact with people. Avoid public transportation whenever possible, limit nonessential travel, work from home and skip social gatherings — and definitely do not go to crowded bars and sporting arenas. “Every single reduction in the number of contacts you have per day with relatives, with friends, co-workers, in school will have a significant impact on the ability of the virus to spread in the population,” said Dr. Gerardo Chowell, chair of population health sciences at Georgia State University. This strategy saved thousands of lives both during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and, more recently, in Mexico City during the 2009 flu pandemic.\n\nThe article continues with expert responses to some common questions about social distancing. Here are excerpts from three:\n\nI’m young and don’t have any risk factors. Can I continue to socialize? Please don’t. There is no question that older people and those with underlying health conditions are most vulnerable to the virus, but young people are by no means immune. And there is a greater public health imperative. Even people who show only mild symptoms may pass the virus to many, many others — particularly in the early course of the infection, before they even realize they are sick. So you might keep the chain of infection going right to your own older or high-risk relatives. You may also contribute to the number of people infected, causing the pandemic to grow rapidly and overwhelm the health care system. If you ignore the guidance on social distancing, you will essentially put yourself and everyone else at much higher risk. Experts acknowledged that social distancing is tough, especially for young people who are used to gathering in groups. But even cutting down the number of gatherings, and the number of people in any group, will help. Can I leave my house? Absolutely. The experts were unanimous in their answer to this question. It’s O.K. to go outdoors for fresh air and exercise — to walk your dog, go for a hike or ride your bicycle, for example. The point is not to remain indoors, but to avoid being in close contact with people. You may also need to leave the house for medicines or other essential resources. But there are things you can do to keep yourself and others safe during and after these excursions. When you do leave your home, wipe down any surfaces you come into contact with, disinfect your hands with an alcohol-based sanitizer and avoid touching your face. Above all, frequently wash your hands — especially whenever you come in from outside, before you eat or before you’re in contact with the very old or very young. How long will we need to practice social distancing? That is a big unknown, experts said. A lot will depend on how well the social distancing measures in place work and how much we can slow the pandemic down. But prepare to hunker down for at least a month, and possibly much longer. In Seattle, the recommendations on social distancing have continued to escalate with the number of infections and deaths, and as the health system has become increasingly strained. “For now, it’s probably indefinite,” Dr. Marrazzo said. “We’re in uncharted territory.”\n\nAbdullah Shihipar writes in an Opinion essay, “Coronavirus and the Isolation Paradox,” that while social distancing is required to prevent infection, loneliness can make us sick:\n\nA paradox of this moment is that while social distancing is required to contain the spread of the coronavirus, it may also contribute to poor health in the long run. So while physical isolation will be required for many Americans who have Covid-19 or have been exposed to it, it’s important that we don’t let such measures cause social and emotional isolation, too. The Health Resources and Services Administration cautions that loneliness can be as damaging to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Feelings of isolation and loneliness can increase the likelihood of depression, high blood pressure, and death from heart disease. They can also affect the immune system’s ability to fight infection — a fact that’s especially relevant during a pandemic. Studies have shown that loneliness can activate our fight-or-flight function, causing chronic inflammation and reducing the body’s ability to defend itself from viruses.\n\nThe essay continues:\n\nFor solutions, we can look to countries where people have been dealing with coronavirus for some time. As the BBC reported, people in China are turning to creative means to stay connected. Some are streaming concerts and gym classes. Others are organizing virtual book-club meetings. In Wuhan, people gathered at their windows to shout “Wuhan, jiayou!” which translates to “Keep fighting, Wuhan!” A business owner packed 200 meals for medical workers, while a villager in a neighboring province donated 15,000 masks to those in need. For those of us who know people, especially elderly people, who may be isolated, get connected. Check in daily and look for ways to spend time together, either through a FaceTime or WhatsApp call, through collaborative gaming or just by using the telephone.\n\nIt concludes:\n\nIt may provide some comfort to know that thousands of other people are going through the same thing, and as in China, collective coping strategies will emerge. TikTok videos, memes, stories, essays and poems about living in isolation will all become part of the culture. We could come out of this feeling more connected to each other than before.\n\nStudents, read ONE of the articles in its entirety, then tell us:\n\nHow is the coronavirus affecting your life — physically, socially and emotionally?

I was actually born in Hong Kong, and I came over to United States with my family and four other siblings in 1969. I’m 12 years old at the time. My parents started working in the garment manufactory. I honestly say that I started working here underage the third day that I get to the United States. I go to school, and then I go to the garment manufactory to work after school.\n\nVery nice to meet you. Good luck. And I’ll definitely come back when it re-opens.\n\nThank you. I hope everybody can reopen to make Chinatown blossom again, you know, more people come back there. I just want to see the street that’s full of people instead of empty. That’s the most important. All right, well, nice meeting you.\n\nWell, I hope you can reopen and eat all those foods again soon with your staff and your family.\n\nFrom my restaurant? So many of them, you know? I have the pumpkin with the short rib. I have the chicken with garlic shallots. I have the lobster with cheese, and so many, so many.\n\nAnd what’s the food that you’re going to miss the most from your restaurant?\n\nIt’s sad, you know? I mean, as I told my staff, I say, they’re like a family to me. So if I don’t see them, I feel that I’m not home. But I hope this virus will go away soon and everybody be healthy.\n\nSince the business keeps going down and my staff is worried about the transportation when they’re traveling, I guess I have no choice but to decide to close up the restaurant as of tomorrow, the 16th. And of course I don’t really like it and I don’t want to, but I have no choice.\n\narchived recording\n\nWhile there are closures and cancellations throughout New York City, there are big crowds outside grocery stores.

It’s not a full-service grocery store, but you can come here to get a few toiletries, or some vegetables, whatever you need for the night. Yeah, I’m going to go in and I’m going to see what’s going on there. So I just walked in the front door, and there’s a lot of people here right now. So there’s about three little counters where people are checking out. Each one is pretty busy right now. There’s a line behind each one of them. I see this one woman right here at the counter. She’s buying a lot of cleaning products, like Lysol wipes and sprays. Hey. Are you JuJu? Nice to meet you.

And I called the guy yesterday and I was like, hey, listen, we don’t have anything. And the guy’s like, you know we don’t deliver on Sunday ever, right? I told him, I was like, look, if you have any common sense as a businessman, and if you have a heart, you’d get your ass up this morning, all right? And you deliver food, all right? Because people are running out. He called me this morning at 7:00 in the morning. He’s like, hey, I’m in front of the store. And he had a full truck. So he didn’t just come serve me. Boar’s Head is a really big company, but each route owner is independent. So that’s where I wanted to come from. This guy got up, left his family to do something like that.

We’re making decisions that affect the whole country and our entire economy — therefore, small errors in navigation could have huge consequences.\n\nOf course, because this virus is potentially affecting so many Americans at once, we need to provide more hospital beds, treatment equipment for those who will need it and protective gear like N95 masks for the doctors and nurses caring for virus-infected patients. That is urgent! And we need to immediately rectify the colossal failure to supply rapid, widespread testing. That is urgent!\n\nBut we also need to be asking ourselves — just as urgently — can we more surgically minimize the threat of this virus to those most vulnerable while we maximize the chances for as many Americans as possible to safely go back to work as soon as possible.

Thank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo, where are you right now?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nNow, I’m at home. After three weeks, today, in the afternoon, I am at home, because I have a big family with three children. And I decide to come back at home one day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you have not been home in three weeks?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThree weeks, yes. I have been in my hospital every day, start of the crisis, Friday the 21st of February. And since then, it was a total mess. It’s like a war, to be honest.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom the New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”\n\n[music]\n\narchived recording This is how Italy’s cases have grown now for the last month — slowly at first, but now more rapidly. It’s a textbook epidemic curve.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nItaly has quickly become the new epicenter of the pandemic, with nearly 30,000 infections and more than 2,000 deaths, numbers that are soaring by the day, even after the government there took extreme measures to lock down much of the country.\n\narchived recording (dr. jerome adams) We are at a critical inflection point in this country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. surgeon general warned that the United States is now on a strikingly similar path.\n\narchived recording (dr. jerome adams) People, we are where Italy was two weeks ago in terms of our numbers. And we have a choice to make as a nation. Do we want to go the direction of South Korea and really be aggressive and lower our mortality rates? Or do we want to go the direction of Italy?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nToday, a conversation with a doctor in Bergamo, north of Milan, one of Italy’s hardest hit areas.\n\n[music]\n\nIt’s Tuesday, March 17.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCould I just ask you to just say your full name for me?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nOK. My name is Fabiano Di Marco. I’m a professor of the University of Milan and the head of the respiratory unit of the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII of Bergamo, which is a town close to Milan.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCan you give me a sense, and maybe paint the picture, of what it’s like in the hospital right now, what you’re dealing with?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI have now — my ward has been totally transformed. Nothing is as before. I’ve been in my hospital every single day for 14 hours or 15 hours a day —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\n— to try to deal with the outbreak of coronavirus infection.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat has been the story of what has happened in your hospital these past few weeks? Because I think people in the United States are desperate to understand what you have seen, and what people have said to you, and what it has looked like. You described it as a war. So we want to understand what you mean.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nOK. Every day we receive, on average, between 50 to 70 patients with severe respiratory failure due to coronavirus infection. Every single day. And to describe my reality, my hospital is, at least in Europe, a huge hospital with 1,000 beds. But to receive every day between 50 and 70 patients with severe pneumonia due to coronavirus, it’s impossible. You have to change your organization day by day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd tell me what you mean. How do you have to change your organization to deal with people who are in such severe respiratory condition?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nSo we change it, the normal ward, mainly surgery wards, because the activity of surgery has been reduced off at least 80 percent. And we transform it, so far five wards of surgery for patients with coronavirus. Now we have, between the five wards and the emergency room, at least 350 patients with respiratory failure due to coronavirus infection.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nToday is the first day in which we have more than 50 percent of the hospital dedicated to coronavirus patients. To organize these, we had to teach cardiologists, dermatologists, rheumatologists — specialists of something very different from respiratory failure — how to treat this patient. You try to find a solution. But day by day, it’s no longer enough. So I can tell you that my colleagues, both physicians and nurses, they cry every day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI’m 47. I’m not so, so old to be the head of a ward, at least in Italy. But I have with me 20 colleagues who are respiratory physician, with many fellow. They are 27, 30. So for me, it’s a huge responsibility. And I was scared they can be sick. OK? But we cry every day. And now, we have today, 460 nurse at home because they are sick. And I think we have —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYes. It’s a very huge number.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou have 460 nurses who are in a hospital in the middle of this crisis who are home because they’re sick?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah, today. This is the outcome of today.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd is that because they are sick with the coronavirus?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThere are some who are sick, some with a total burnout for the situation, and other who are contact of patients, so they stay in quarantine at home.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDoctor, you said you are upset, that you maybe even cry every day. And I wonder if there is an experience, maybe one story or one patient, that made you upset?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThe main problem for us is to treat our colleagues. As doctor, we are used to treat patients. And for us it’s normal. There is not so emotional, luckily, because we are used to treat other people. But this is difficult when the patient is your colleague. And we have now admitted tens of colleagues or nurse, people who you will meet every day in your life.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYour colleagues are now your patients because they have contracted the virus.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. For example, yesterday, the chief of my department come to the emergency room to be with a low level of oxygenation. He has a bilateral pneumonia due to coronavirus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. I’m sorry.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nNot very severe. But he was someone who tried to organize the hospital to deal with this infection three days ago. And we went to have a dinner with my wife and his wife one week ago.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI don’t know. We are scared because on Friday, only in my hospital, we had 20 deaths.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n20 deaths.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. For coronavirus. In one day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat’s extraordinary.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. So another important thing, we have not had the opportunity to allow the relative to come to the hospital for two reasons. First, it’s a danger for them and for other people, evidently, because in 80 percent of the cases, they are infected. The second reason, which is not easy to understand if you are not in this situation, is that we do not have enough personal protective equipment — the mask in case of infection, something to cover the shoes, and the gown. It’s impossible to find these now Europe, not only in Italy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you’re running out of those and you can’t get them anywhere, in the region or anywhere in Europe. You just can’t get them.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. Impossible to find.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nIf I allow one or two relative to come to the hospital, I have to give them these. But we do not have this for us.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. You need them for doctors.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. They cannot receive the relative in hospital. So the patients are alone. And they die alone. We — this is difficult for us. We try to call, every day, the relative. But I have to tell you that sometimes, in the confusion of this new organization with a dermatologist who is trying to treat a patient with severe respiratory failure, and probably the doctors cry, and the — no one remember to call the relative. So it’s happened that the relative call the hospital —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd the person’s already dead.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back. Doctor, you’ve mentioned a lot of the choices that you and your staff have to make now that this is such a terrible situation. And I wonder how you make decisions about who gets which treatment, and who has the best chance to survive. How do you make those decisions?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThis is, for us, a crucial point, because we have hundreds of very sick patients. But we have tens of I.C.U. beds.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThe problem is that you can find many scores of gravity. But these scores of gravity have been thought for another reason. OK?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd when you say score of gravity, you mean, basically, kind of a calculation of who is in greatest need?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. So for instance, if you are 80, you have a severe respiratory failure, and I don’t know, you have also renal failure, I have to admit you in the I.C.U. because you are very severe. And you have a probability to die very high. OK. I have to admit you in the I.C.U.. But now we need another score, which is a score which help us to understand your probability to benefit of the I.C.U. bed. And we do not have this score. OK?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBecause it has not been created.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. We are trying to do this now, because for example, the age, for all of the stage of severity, higher is the age, higher is the score. But when you have few beds for many people, the age is absolutely the opposite. If you are 85, I give the bed to another one who is 45.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBecause 45-year-old is more likely to benefit from the I.C.U. bed than the 80-year-old. So you’re saying all the normal rules have to be thrown out the window.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. We need a new tool we do not have, because so far, the difference between the number of patients, number or bed, is something totally new for us. OK? And not only for us, all the country will have to deal with this. But it’s difficult to tell people that if you are 80, you will never have the I.C.U. bed.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOf course.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nBut so far, if you have not the opportunity to build a new hospital with 1,000 bed, such as in China, we need this terrible tool, because this is a tool of selection.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight — of who lives and who dies.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. And this is why it’s important. If you do not reduce the number of patients who are sick, it’s impossible to deal with this disease. Impossible. You have to reduce the rate of infection. And the only way to reduce the rate of infection is to change totally the life of people. Now, in Italy, everyone is at home. This is a tragedy for economy. No one is working. No one is working. But it’s the only way. There is not something in between.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like you’re saying that once you are in a hospital as a doctor, looking at a room full of people with this virus, overwhelmed, it’s too late. That the role of countries who are not yet at the place Italy is in is to make sure they don’t ever get to that place, don’t ever get to the point that your hospital is at. And to do whatever it takes to not get there.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. You have two choices. You decide to not close all the activities, close the people in their home, and you will accept thousand of beds. Or, you have to close all the activity. There is not a choice in between. I know this is difficult to have this approach, because also in Italy, if you speak with my colleague in another town, it’s quite difficult to understand this. Because many people, including many physicians, have not this perception of this. Because in your reality, all is normal. It’s difficult to be scared for something you have not the perception. OK? So I can understand that in other countries, it’s the same. But trust us, or, such as in Bergamo, each family will have a relative or a friend who dies. This is the situation in Bergamo. This is not a disease that you can discuss on TV, or you will have the perception of this in your family, in your relative, in your town. It’s something very aggressive, very aggressive.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder, as a doctor, what advice you would give to doctors in the United States who may have to do what you have to do and make the kind of difficult decisions that you have to make now.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI think that the best is to speak with us to analyze the situation of Italy. It could be something important. Because you have to be prepared for this. This is the only thing I would suggest to my colleague. Because also in Italy, I have some colleague in the other part of Italy who are not prepared. And I speak with them. They are doing the same thing we did three weeks ago. This is incredible. This new reality we are living started the 23rd of February, not three years ago. OK? Three weeks ago. After three weeks, we are living in another dimension. For me, it’s difficult to think to my life before this. No one can be prepared for this — impossible.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder, just a final question here. At the beginning of our conversation, you said you were finally home after three weeks. And I wonder what it was like to come home to your family. What are you telling them? And how are you feeling?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nMy children are at home now for three weeks. The schools are closed. Luckily there are three, so they can stay together. But we try to create a normal situation at home. For me, it’s difficult, because evidently, I have a risk of infection which is higher than compared to other people. So I had to decide what to do at home. If stay with a mask — sorry. And I decide to stay normal, without the mask.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like this was a tough decision.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah, because I have to find the solution between to protect the best, uh, my wife and do not scare my children. OK? The only good news is that children and young boys or girls are not affected. This is the only consolation for us. And I decide that I changed my approach to my children. OK? I pay attention to my hands. I pay attention to my towel. OK? But I decide to not wear a mask because it will be difficult for them to see the father who is a respiratory physician in Bergamo with those kind of cases, hundreds of that. So also for these, it’s really difficult to decide what is the best. And then I spoke with my wife. And we decided to do this.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like on top of all the difficult decisions you’ve had to make, you had to go home and make one more difficult decision, which was this mask.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. Absolutely.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDoctor, I really want to thank you so much for giving us your time. And I want to wish you the best of luck, you and all your colleagues, doctors and nurses at the hospital. We’re going to be thinking about you a lot in the coming days.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThank you. Thank you. It has been a privilege. I hope, indeed, to be useful for some of my colleagues and for you.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) This afternoon, we’re announcing new guidelines for every American to follow over the next 15 days. As we combat the virus, each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday, President Trump issued sweeping new health guidelines for Americans, encouraging them to work from home, avoid restaurants, bars, and food courts, and discretionary travel, and limit gatherings to 10 people or fewer.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation. And we will defeat the virus. And we’re going to have a big celebration all together.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut the guidelines are not mandatory. And the president stopped short of explicitly ordering Americans to stay home, as several countries in Europe and a handful of U.S. counties are now doing. On Monday, health officials in the Bay Area of California instructed nearly 7 million people to remain in their homes, with few exceptions, to slow the virus’s spread.\n\narchived recording These new orders direct all individuals to shelter at their place of residence and maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet from any other person when outside their residence. We know we need to do this. And we know we need a regional approach.\n\nmichael barbaro", "location": ["Maine", "Oregon", "South Korea", "China", "Milan", "Europe", "The United States", "Italy", "United States", "The Bay Area", "Indiana", "I.C.U"], "gpt_analysis": {"tone": "tragic", "framing": "systemic injustice", "group_mentions": ["healthcare workers", "elderly", "families", "children"], "metaphors": ["war", "battle", "crisis"], "euphemisms": ["passed away", "no longer with us"], "absences": ["poverty", "racism", "long COVID", "workplace safety", "healthcare access"], "grief_handling": "communal", "blame_or_agency": "The article suggests systemic failures in healthcare capacity and resource allocation, implying that the deaths could have been mitigated with better preparation and resources.", "commodification_of_death": "The article treats death as a statistic and a crisis management issue, highlighting numbers and capacity rather than individual stories."}}, {"headline": "Wuhan Rounds Up the Infected as Death Toll in China Jumps", "source": "The New York Times", "publish_date": "Mar 12, 2020", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html", "article_text": "gps voice [SPEAKING MANDARIN] amy qin I’ll say a few things. So it’s a rainy day. Very, very gloomy, rainy day. And it’s a little loud because we have to keep the windows open, because that’s the recommendation in these situations. You have to keep everything ventilated.\n\n[music]\n\namy qin\n\nTwo weeks ago, our researcher Elsie and I went down to Wuhan, which is this major city in the center of China that has been the epicenter of the recent coronavirus outbreak. By then, it had been under lockdown for about a week. And we were really curious to see how people were faring and what was going on, especially at the hospitals there. We took the train from Beijing to Wuhan. And we got off, and what we saw was totally crazy. I mean, we’d never seen anything like it. This is a city of 11 million that had come to a complete standstill. It felt like being in a parallel reality. To see those streets completely empty was really striking. It was eerie to hear the silence. And the only time we heard anything was the occasional barking of a dog or an ambulance passing by. We were walking around this hospital and we walked into the courtyard in front of the outpatient department. And that’s where we came upon this very jarring scene. You had 30 or so patients that were all kind of sitting quietly in the courtyard, all hooked up to IV drips that were hanging from tree branches or in their cars.\n\ninterposing voices [SPEAKING MANDARIN]\n\namy qin\n\nWe meet this mother and her two children who are all hooked up to IVs. The mother’s name is Yang Ling.\n\nyang ling [SPEAKING MANDARIN]\n\namy qin\n\nThey tell me that they are actually a family of six. There’s Yang Ling. There is her husband, her husband’s parents and then their son and their daughter. And they have all been staying together. And she tells us that their grandmother got sick first and one by one, each of them has gotten infected by the coronavirus. And now, her husband is the only one that doesn’t have coronavirus.\n\nyang ling [SPEAKING MANDARIN]\n\namy qin\n\nAnd then they tell me that just one week after the grandmother started showing symptoms, their grandfather died.\n\nyang ling [SPEAKING MANDARIN]\n\namy qin\n\nShe tells us that after the grandfather dies, the funeral home comes to take the body away —\n\nyang ling [SPEAKING MANDARIN]\n\namy qin\n\n— and he is cremated immediately. And she says that —\n\nyang ling [SPEAKING MANDARIN]\n\namy qin\n\n— he was taken away just like a dead dog or a dead pig.\n\nyang ling [SPEAKING MANDARIN]\n\namy qin\n\nAs she’s talking, her voice is starting to carry across the courtyard outside this hospital. And other people are starting to listen in and crowd around us, and she’s starting to get more and more upset. She was so palpably angry that at one point —\n\nyang ling [SPEAKING MANDARIN]\n\namy qin\n\n— the mother was waving her arms around in frustration and almost ripped the IV needle out of her hand.\n\nyang ling [SPEAKING MANDARIN]\n\namy qin\n\nI’ve been covering China for seven years. And I’ve heard people express frustrations with the government before, but really only in private. This was one of the few times that I’ve heard such raw anger toward the government publicly.\n\nyang ling [SPEAKING MANDARIN]\n\namy qin\n\nAnd she basically says, is this really my country or is this some kind of [EXPLETIVE] up country — a country that doesn’t take care of anything?\n\nyang ling [SPEAKING MANDARIN].\n\namy qin\n\nAnd then she says, what kind of government is this? And after hearing that, that made me think that something was happening that was bigger than just an outbreak of a virus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: Inside China, what began as a story of fear over the coronavirus has now become the story of fury over the government’s handling of the crisis. Beijing correspondent Amy Qin on what she saw in Wuhan. It’s Thursday, February 13. Amy, what is it about this moment that you think is making people like the Zhang family feel free to speak out about their anger and to pretty explicitly criticize the Chinese government?\n\namy qin\n\nSo for the Zhang family, this is for them a matter of life or death. And it was a common feeling I heard throughout the city. But there’s another added frustration boiling across the rest of the country about how the government is handling this crisis. And for them, it’s really been captured in the story of this doctor named Dr. Li Wenliang.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd who is this doctor?\n\namy qin\n\nSo Li Wenliang is an eye doctor at a hospital in Wuhan. And he had heard about this virus back in December that was going around the hospitals in the city. And so he went on WeChat, which is this big social messaging platform, and sent in a private messaging group with some of his med school classmates a text message basically warning them to protect themselves. And a few days later after he sent that message, he was actually called in by the police in Wuhan. They brought him into the police station and they made him sign a statement saying that he was spreading false and illegal information — basically, that he was spreading rumors.\n\narchived recording Authorities say it is untrue and eight people were detained for spreading fake news online and no medical staff had been infected.\n\namy qin\n\nBut of course, it wasn’t a rumor.\n\narchived recording Chinese health authorities are still working to identify the virus behind a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of Wuhan.\n\namy qin\n\nBy the time Dr. Li was brought into the police station, 41 people had the coronavirus. And from there, it just spread.\n\narchived recording 1 A SARS-like virus, which has infected hundreds in China, has now reached the United States. archived recording 2 Now China has announced the first death from an outbreak of pneumonia caused by an unidentified virus. archived recording 3 121 people are under medical observation in Wuhan. Rumors on social media alleged that the outbreak in Wuhan could be linked to SARS. archived recording 4 The World Health Organization says it’s a new type of coronavirus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Amy, at this point, what is happening to Dr. Li?\n\namy qin\n\nSo after Dr. Li gets taken into the police station and forced to sign this statement, he was actually treating a patient for glaucoma. And she wasn’t showing any symptoms at the time, but he ended up contracting the virus from her.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\namy qin\n\nAnd from his sickbed, he starts to speak out again.\n\narchived recording In a matter of days, Dr. Li Wenliang went from treating patients to becoming one.\n\namy qin\n\nHe gives some interviews to Chinese media and he starts to become this public figure.\n\narchived recording Struggling to communicate, Li spoke with CNN briefly by phone. You can hear the hospital machines pulsing in the background.\n\namy qin\n\nHe becomes known as a whistleblower —\n\narchived recording Whistleblowers silenced by police. Calls for Li and the others to be vindicated grew online.\n\namy qin\n\n— that the government didn’t act fast enough on information that they were given, and that they had missed this critical window of opportunity to get the outbreak under control.\n\narchived recording China’s Supreme Court even weighed in, adding quote, “It might have been a fortunate thing if the public had listened to this rumor at the time.” But for many —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo he’s becoming a kind of spokesperson for a lot of frustrations.\n\namy qin\n\nExactly.\n\narchived recording (li wenliang) [INAUDIBLE] [COUGHING]\n\namy qin\n\nAnd so at this point, it just feels like there is no light at the end of the tunnel.\n\narchived recording 1 Now, the death toll in the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China has jumped to 17. archived recording 2 Hundreds of people have been diagnosed with a deadly virus known as the 2019 novel coronavirus. archived recording 3 Overall, there are now more than 31,500 confirmed cases worldwide.\n\namy qin\n\nMore and more people are getting sick. We’re seeing the numbers just surge every day —\n\narchived recording 4 600 deaths.\n\namy qin\n\n— people who are confirmed cases of the coronavirus, people who are dying of the coronavirus.\n\narchived recording 5 Has jumped to more than 700.\n\namy qin\n\nEverything felt so uncertain.\n\narchived recording 6 Officials are imposing restrictions on travel out of Wuhan, China. archived recording 7 And 13 cities in lockdown this morning. archived recording 8 Near-empty shelves line supermarkets. archived recording 9 A need for masks and protective suits. archived recording 10 China’s health minister, Ma Xiaowei, has said that he expects infections to continue to rise. And of course, that has everyone here in the country even more nervous. archived recording 11 The citizens are actually freaking out. archived recording 12 China right now is being massively rocked by anger. archived recording 13 And the State Department has said it is chartering a flight to evacuate Americans out of Wuhan. Justin, though, will not be on that —\n\namy qin\n\nSo foreign governments started pulling their citizens out of Wuhan, and that’s when I got the call. So it was late last week, and I had been on the phone all day with my editors. And I get a final call saying you need to go to the airport. There was one flight left that was being arranged by the U.S. State Department to go back to the U.S., so I start scrambling. I leave all my masks, my disinfectant wipes, my hazmat suit, my gloves with my colleagues. And then it’s about a 40-minute drive to the airport.\n\namy qin O.K. So I am at the airport in Wuhan now. And it’s been a crazy, hectic day. I think that the next few weeks in quarantine on a military base will bring its own interesting moments.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what is the scene at the airport?\n\namy qin\n\nThe scene at the airport was a little bit frenzied. I mean, at this point, these are really some of the last flights out for these countries who are evacuating their citizens, so it wasn’t just the Americans. There were also the Canadians, the Japanese. And we didn’t even know at that point where they were taking us to. So I’m in the airport lobby and I’m waiting for my flight. And then my phone starts to buzz, and I’m seeing all these messages come through. And I look at them, and then I see that Dr. Li has just died. And I could sense that this was going to be a big moment, because I had started overhearing people talking about it in the airport terminal. But then I just had to leave. I had to get on the flight.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back. So Amy, Dr. Li has died from the very virus that he alerted the government to, and you’re on a plane back to the U.S. from Wuhan. So what happens once you land?\n\namy qin\n\nSo once I land, I find that I am at the Miramar Marine base in San Diego, California. I’m carted off to quarantine, and then I turn on my phone and I start going through my messages. And I see this huge upswelling of outrage over Dr. Li’s death. People from every stripe of the political or social spectrum in China — so you have people who are business people, who are blue-collar workers, artists, lawyers — they’re all posting about Dr. Li’s death. And I’ve never seen people come together like this before — and people were so upset about his death.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what are they saying?\n\namy qin\n\nA lot of people were posting candle emojis and other kinds of remembrances for Dr. Li. They were posting photos of him. He had taken a selfie of himself wearing a surgical mask and someone had recreated that image to replace the surgical mask with barbed wire to kind of indicate that he had been muzzled. Some people were posting the anthem from “Les Mis,” “Do you hear the people sing? Singing a song of angry men?”\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\namy qin\n\nWe actually saw the hashtag “I want freedom of speech” trending for five hours, which of course, it was quickly censored. And we saw petitions going up by Chinese academics calling for freedom of speech. And we even saw a local government social media account posting a portrait of Dr. Li, along with the lines, “Heroes don’t fall from the sky. They’re just ordinary people who step forward.”\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\namy qin\n\nSo the reaction is really remarkable. I mean, even the hospital where Dr. Li died posted an official notice of his death. And that had three million reactions and 300,000 comments. And so it was so clear that this was something that had really tapped into the frustration that was happening.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what do you make of those reactions? Because it feels like it no longer is really just about this virus and the way that it was handled?\n\namy qin\n\nYeah so at this point, it is clear that this is becoming so much bigger than just the virus. This is really about the government and this social contract that the people have had with the government, where they agree to keep silent as long as the government provides for their prosperity and health. It operates under this principle of stability at all costs.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. And in their effort to create stability, in fact, they did the opposite.\n\namy qin\n\nYeah. I mean, I think that there’s this realization definitely that there is something wrong with the system. And I don’t think that it means that people are going out in the streets and calling for a revolution. But the fact that people are calling for freedom of speech, I mean, that’s really what this brought out. People in China are already used to a pretty high level of censorship, but when it comes to censoring a warning about public health, that goes too far. And the reaction is so overwhelming that the government quickly realizes that they need to do something. And that’s when we see China’s leader Xi Jinping come forward out of the shadows and try to take control of the situation\n\narchived recording (xi jinping) [SPEAKING CHINESE] [LAUGHTER]\n\namy qin\n\nHe comes out and makes an appearance in Beijing.\n\narchived recording (xi jinping) [SPEAKING CHINESE]\n\namy qin\n\nHe visits a community center and a hospital. He gets his temperature taken. He talks with local residents.\n\narchived recording (xi jinping) [SPEAKING CHINESE]\n\namy qin\n\nAnd he does a video conference with doctors in Wuhan.\n\narchived recording (xi jinping) [SPEAKING CHINESE] [APPLAUSE]\n\namy qin\n\nSo by this point, the government has sent the nation’s top anti-corruption agency to go down to Wuhan and investigate Dr. Li’s death. And state media is calling Dr. Li a hero.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThis feels like a real shift for a government that originally reprimanded Dr. Li and is now sending a team to investigate why he was muzzled. It feels like a concession.\n\namy qin\n\nIt is. But at the same time, we have to remember that this is also part of the party’s ethos, which is to always try to control the narrative. And for them, the path of least resistance in this situation is to hold Dr. Li up as a hero, but also to do it in a way that coheres with the party narrative.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh.\n\namy qin\n\nErasing the parts that might challenge their legitimacy or authority, which is the fact that he was punished by the government for trying to call attention to the fact that there was this virus going around.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDo you think that the people in China view the government’s response as an attempt to protect them from the virus or to protect the government from the story of a situation that’s out of control?\n\namy qin\n\nBoth. People really believe that the government wants to get this epidemic under control. But at the same time, they know that the government is only going to do this in a way that does not threaten its own hold on power. And that means taking control of the narrative — sending in their own journalists to make sure that only the positive aspects of what they’re doing is being highlighted, and that people who are slipping through the cracks or all the failures of the policy are not being highlighted.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAmy, I’m curious. Have you been able to speak to the Zhang family since you evacuated, since you took that flight from Wuhan to California?\n\namy qin\n\nWe have. The last time we checked in with them, their situation had changed. The mother and the daughter were both infected with the coronavirus and have finally been able to get into one of the makeshift quarantine centers set up by the government. Bella, the daughter, sent us a video of the center, and it just shows a huge exhibition center with beds crowded tightly together and all these sick patients in these beds. Meanwhile, Bella’s brother and their grandmother are still at home back in the family apartment sick and unable to get into a hospital. The grandmother is in very serious condition. She can barely get out of bed. And they’re also still living with their father, who is the only family member who hasn’t gotten infected so fae. Though they all think that it will be a matter of time.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo basically, half the family is being cared for and the other half have been kind of abandoned.\n\namy qin\n\nRight. And remember, their grandfather had died in their family apartment and was taken to be cremated immediately. And they still don’t even know where his ashes are.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIs the reality that another death in the family could happen something that they are preparing for?\n\namy qin\n\nYes, they’ve been planning for it. They told us that when the grandmother dies, they’re not going to let her go to the crematorium. But actually, the mother said she’s going to drag her body to the local neighborhood committee and just put it there on the front steps to show them how their inaction has devastated their entire family.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDo you know whether the family knows about Dr. Li’s death, or if they were able to watch that video of Xi Jinping in public addressing the situation?\n\namy qin\n\nI think if they’ve seen, it’s barely registered. They are so consumed with just trying to survive right now, like so many other people in Wuhan, that they’re just putting their heads down trying to move forward.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAmy, thank you very much.\n\namy qin\n\nThanks, Michael.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Thursday, nearly 15,000 new cases of coronavirus were added to the tally of infected people in the Chinese province where Wuhan is located — the largest one-day increase of the epidemic so far. That brings the total number of cases to more than 48,000. At the same time, 242 new deaths were also reported, bringing the total death toll in the province to 1,310. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. For the second day in a row, President Trump intervened in the prosecution of his longtime friend and adviser, Roger Stone, this time by attacking the judge in the case. On Tuesday, at the president’s urging, the Department of Justice recommended a more lenient prison sentence for Stone, who was convicted of obstructing a congressional investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. That move prompted four federal prosecutors to leave the case in protest. On Wednesday, Trump claimed without evidence in a tweet that the judge who will sentence Stone is biased against the president in what Democratic lawmakers said was a clear attempt to intimidate the judge before she sentences Stone.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) The president ran against the swamp in Washington, a place where the game is rigged by the powerful to benefit them personally. I ask my fellow Americans, what is more swampy, what is more fetid, what is more stinking than the most powerful person in the country literally changing the rules to benefit a crony guilty of breaking the law?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn response, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for an investigation into Trump’s conduct.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) As a result, I have formally requested that the inspector general of the Justice Department investigate this matter immediately.\n\nmichael barbaro", "location": ["Maine", "Oregon", "San Diego", "China", "Washington", "California", "The United States", "Massachusetts", "Wuhan", "United States", "Indiana", "Beijing"], "gpt_analysis": {"tone": "tragic", "framing": "political failure", "group_mentions": ["elderly", "families", "healthcare workers", "government officials"], "metaphors": ["war", "fight", "disaster"], "euphemisms": ["taken away just like a dead dog or a dead pig"], "absences": ["poverty", "racism", "healthcare access"], "grief_handling": "communal", "blame_or_agency": "The article assigns responsibility to the Chinese government for mishandling the crisis and suppressing information.", "commodification_of_death": "The article treats death as a political talking point, highlighting the government\'s failure and public outrage."}}, {"headline": "Opinion | Where Is God in a Pandemic?", "source": "The New York Times", "publish_date": "Mar 22, 2020", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/opinion/coronavirus-religion.html", "article_text": "In the end, the most honest answer to the question of why the Covid-19 virus is killing thousands of people, why infectious diseases ravage humanity and why there is suffering at all is: We don’t know. For me, this is the most honest and accurate answer. One could also suggest how viruses are part of the natural world and in some way contribute to life, but this approach fails abjectly when speaking to someone who has lost a friend or loved one. An important question for the believer in times of suffering is this: Can you believe in a God that you don’t understand?\n\nBut if the mystery of suffering is unanswerable, where can the believer go in times like this? For the Christian and perhaps even for others the answer is Jesus.\n\nChristians believe that Jesus is fully divine and fully human. Yet we sometimes overlook the second part. Jesus of Nazareth was born into a world of illness. In her book “Stone and Dung, Oil and Spit,” about daily life in first-century Galilee, Jodi Magness, a scholar of early Judaism, calls the milieu in which Jesus lived “filthy, malodorous and unhealthy.” John Dominic Crossan and Jonathan L. Reed, scholars of the historical background of Jesus, sum up these conditions in a sobering sentence in “Excavating Jesus”: “A case of the flu, a bad cold, or an abscessed tooth could kill.” This was Jesus’s world.\n\nMoreover, in his public ministry, Jesus continually sought out those who were sick. Most of his miracles were healings from illnesses and disabilities: debilitating skin conditions (under the rubric of “leprosy”), epilepsy, a woman’s “flow of blood,” a withered hand, “dropsy,” blindness, deafness, paralysis. In these frightening times, Christians may find comfort in knowing that when they pray to Jesus, they are praying to someone who understands them not only because he is divine and knows all things, but because he is human and experienced all things.\n\nBut those who are not Christian can also see him as a model for care of the sick. Needless to say, when caring for someone with coronavirus, one should take the necessary precautions in order not to pass on the infection. But for Jesus, the sick or dying person was not the “other,” not one to be blamed, but our brother and sister. When Jesus saw a person in need, the Gospels tell us that his heart was “moved with pity.” He is a model for how we are to care during this crisis: with hearts moved by pity.\n\nWhenever I prayed in that church near 68th and York, I would pause before a statue of Jesus, his arms outstretched, his heart exposed. Just a plaster statue, it wasn’t great art, but it was meaningful to me. I don’t understand why people are dying, but I can follow the person who gives me a pattern for life.\n\nJames Martin is a Jesuit priest, editor at large of America magazine, consultor to the Vatican’s Dicastery for Communication and the author of “Jesus: A Pilgrimage.”\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

It’s a textbook epidemic curve.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nItaly has quickly become the new epicenter of the pandemic, with nearly 30,000 infections and more than 2,000 deaths, numbers that are soaring by the day, even after the government there took extreme measures to lock down much of the country.\n\narchived recording (dr. jerome adams) We are at a critical inflection point in this country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. surgeon general warned that the United States is now on a strikingly similar path.\n\narchived recording (dr. jerome adams) People, we are where Italy was two weeks ago in terms of our numbers.

My name is Fabiano Di Marco. I’m a professor of the University of Milan and the head of the respiratory unit of the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII of Bergamo, which is a town close to Milan.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCan you give me a sense, and maybe paint the picture, of what it’s like in the hospital right now, what you’re dealing with?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI have now — my ward has been totally transformed. Nothing is as before. I’ve been in my hospital every single day for 14 hours or 15 hours a day —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\n— to try to deal with the outbreak of coronavirus infection.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat has been the story of what has happened in your hospital these past few weeks? Because I think people in the United States are desperate to understand what you have seen, and what people have said to you, and what it has looked like. You described it as a war. So we want to understand what you mean.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nOK. Every day we receive, on average, between 50 to 70 patients with severe respiratory failure due to coronavirus infection. Every single day. And to describe my reality, my hospital is, at least in Europe, a huge hospital with 1,000 beds. But to receive every day between 50 and 70 patients with severe pneumonia due to coronavirus, it’s impossible. You have to change your organization day by day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd tell me what you mean. How do you have to change your organization to deal with people who are in such severe respiratory condition?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nSo we change it, the normal ward, mainly surgery wards, because the activity of surgery has been reduced off at least 80 percent. And we transform it, so far five wards of surgery for patients with coronavirus. Now we have, between the five wards and the emergency room, at least 350 patients with respiratory failure due to coronavirus infection.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nToday is the first day in which we have more than 50 percent of the hospital dedicated to coronavirus patients. To organize these, we had to teach cardiologists, dermatologists, rheumatologists — specialists of something very different from respiratory failure — how to treat this patient. You try to find a solution. But day by day, it’s no longer enough. So I can tell you that my colleagues, both physicians and nurses, they cry every day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI’m 47. I’m not so, so old to be the head of a ward, at least in Italy. But I have with me 20 colleagues who are respiratory physician, with many fellow. They are 27, 30. So for me, it’s a huge responsibility. And I was scared they can be sick. OK? But we cry every day. And now, we have today, 460 nurse at home because they are sick. And I think we have —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYes. It’s a very huge number.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou have 460 nurses who are in a hospital in the middle of this crisis who are home because they’re sick?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah, today. This is the outcome of today.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd is that because they are sick with the coronavirus?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThere are some who are sick, some with a total burnout for the situation, and other who are contact of patients, so they stay in quarantine at home.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDoctor, you said you are upset, that you maybe even cry every day. And I wonder if there is an experience, maybe one story or one patient, that made you upset?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThe main problem for us is to treat our colleagues. As doctor, we are used to treat patients. And for us it’s normal. There is not so emotional, luckily, because we are used to treat other people. But this is difficult when the patient is your colleague. And we have now admitted tens of colleagues or nurse, people who you will meet every day in your life.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYour colleagues are now your patients because they have contracted the virus.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. For example, yesterday, the chief of my department come to the emergency room to be with a low level of oxygenation. He has a bilateral pneumonia due to coronavirus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. I’m sorry.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nNot very severe. But he was someone who tried to organize the hospital to deal with this infection three days ago. And we went to have a dinner with my wife and his wife one week ago.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI don’t know. We are scared because on Friday, only in my hospital, we had 20 deaths.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n20 deaths.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. For coronavirus. In one day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat’s extraordinary.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. So another important thing, we have not had the opportunity to allow the relative to come to the hospital for two reasons. First, it’s a danger for them and for other people, evidently, because in 80 percent of the cases, they are infected. The second reason, which is not easy to understand if you are not in this situation, is that we do not have enough personal protective equipment — the mask in case of infection, something to cover the shoes, and the gown. It’s impossible to find these now Europe, not only in Italy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you’re running out of those and you can’t get them anywhere, in the region or anywhere in Europe. You just can’t get them.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. Impossible to find.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nIf I allow one or two relative to come to the hospital, I have to give them these. But we do not have this for us.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. You need them for doctors.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. They cannot receive the relative in hospital. So the patients are alone. And they die alone. We — this is difficult for us. We try to call, every day, the relative. But I have to tell you that sometimes, in the confusion of this new organization with a dermatologist who is trying to treat a patient with severe respiratory failure, and probably the doctors cry, and the — no one remember to call the relative. So it’s happened that the relative call the hospital —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd the person’s already dead.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back. Doctor, you’ve mentioned a lot of the choices that you and your staff have to make now that this is such a terrible situation. And I wonder how you make decisions about who gets which treatment, and who has the best chance to survive. How do you make those decisions?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThis is, for us, a crucial point, because we have hundreds of very sick patients. But we have tens of I.C.U. beds.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThe problem is that you can find many scores of gravity. But these scores of gravity have been thought for another reason. OK?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd when you say score of gravity, you mean, basically, kind of a calculation of who is in greatest need?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. So for instance, if you are 80, you have a severe respiratory failure, and I don’t know, you have also renal failure, I have to admit you in the I.C.U. because you are very severe. And you have a probability to die very high. OK. I have to admit you in the I.C.U.. But now we need another score, which is a score which help us to understand your probability to benefit of the I.C.U. bed. And we do not have this score. OK?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBecause it has not been created.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. We are trying to do this now, because for example, the age, for all of the stage of severity, higher is the age, higher is the score. But when you have few beds for many people, the age is absolutely the opposite. If you are 85, I give the bed to another one who is 45.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBecause 45-year-old is more likely to benefit from the I.C.U. bed than the 80-year-old. So you’re saying all the normal rules have to be thrown out the window.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. We need a new tool we do not have, because so far, the difference between the number of patients, number or bed, is something totally new for us. OK? And not only for us, all the country will have to deal with this. But it’s difficult to tell people that if you are 80, you will never have the I.C.U. bed.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOf course.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nBut so far, if you have not the opportunity to build a new hospital with 1,000 bed, such as in China, we need this terrible tool, because this is a tool of selection.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight — of who lives and who dies.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. And this is why it’s important. If you do not reduce the number of patients who are sick, it’s impossible to deal with this disease. Impossible. You have to reduce the rate of infection. And the only way to reduce the rate of infection is to change totally the life of people. Now, in Italy, everyone is at home. This is a tragedy for economy. No one is working. No one is working. But it’s the only way. There is not something in between.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like you’re saying that once you are in a hospital as a doctor, looking at a room full of people with this virus, overwhelmed, it’s too late. That the role of countries who are not yet at the place Italy is in is to make sure they don’t ever get to that place, don’t ever get to the point that your hospital is at. And to do whatever it takes to not get there.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. You have two choices. You decide to not close all the activities, close the people in their home, and you will accept thousand of beds. Or, you have to close all the activity. There is not a choice in between. I know this is difficult to have this approach, because also in Italy, if you speak with my colleague in another town, it’s quite difficult to understand this. Because many people, including many physicians, have not this perception of this. Because in your reality, all is normal. It’s difficult to be scared for something you have not the perception. OK? So I can understand that in other countries, it’s the same. But trust us, or, such as in Bergamo, each family will have a relative or a friend who dies. This is the situation in Bergamo. This is not a disease that you can discuss on TV, or you will have the perception of this in your family, in your relative, in your town. It’s something very aggressive, very aggressive.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder, as a doctor, what advice you would give to doctors in the United States who may have to do what you have to do and make the kind of difficult decisions that you have to make now.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI think that the best is to speak with us to analyze the situation of Italy. It could be something important. Because you have to be prepared for this. This is the only thing I would suggest to my colleague. Because also in Italy, I have some colleague in the other part of Italy who are not prepared. And I speak with them. They are doing the same thing we did three weeks ago. This is incredible. This new reality we are living started the 23rd of February, not three years ago. OK? Three weeks ago. After three weeks, we are living in another dimension. For me, it’s difficult to think to my life before this. No one can be prepared for this — impossible.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder, just a final question here. At the beginning of our conversation, you said you were finally home after three weeks. And I wonder what it was like to come home to your family. What are you telling them? And how are you feeling?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nMy children are at home now for three weeks. The schools are closed. Luckily there are three, so they can stay together. But we try to create a normal situation at home. For me, it’s difficult, because evidently, I have a risk of infection which is higher than compared to other people. So I had to decide what to do at home. If stay with a mask — sorry. And I decide to stay normal, without the mask.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like this was a tough decision.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah, because I have to find the solution between to protect the best, uh, my wife and do not scare my children. OK? The only good news is that children and young boys or girls are not affected. This is the only consolation for us. And I decide that I changed my approach to my children. OK? I pay attention to my hands. I pay attention to my towel. OK? But I decide to not wear a mask because it will be difficult for them to see the father who is a respiratory physician in Bergamo with those kind of cases, hundreds of that. So also for these, it’s really difficult to decide what is the best. And then I spoke with my wife. And we decided to do this.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like on top of all the difficult decisions you’ve had to make, you had to go home and make one more difficult decision, which was this mask.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. Absolutely.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDoctor, I really want to thank you so much for giving us your time. And I want to wish you the best of luck, you and all your colleagues, doctors and nurses at the hospital. We’re going to be thinking about you a lot in the coming days.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThank you. Thank you. It has been a privilege. I hope, indeed, to be useful for some of my colleagues and for you.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back.

It depends on what you put your hands on. clare toeniskoetter I wanted to ask you. We heard you, yesterday, sanitizing the studio. What do you do when you come home? donald g. mcneil jr. I wash my hands. I know the inside of my house is clean, because the only people in here are my girlfriend and myself, and we’re both still healthy. But people who live upstairs — and this is a two-apartment building — we have agreed that we will tell each other if any of us has a fever or a cough, and we keep some alcohol wipes in the front hall to wipe down the doorknob, light switch, and other surfaces we might both touch, just to make sure that there’s no possibility of us passing it back and forth to each other. I know it sounds kooky, but this is actually the way the disease gets transmitted. You don’t have to be a crazy germaphobe. Or actually, at a time like this, it helps to be a crazy germaphobe just by instinct. And here. I’ll wash my hands in front of you so that you know that my hands are clean. But the danger with somebody else is, of course, that they’re coughing. But I’m not. I’m fine. clare toeniskoetter I’ve never been in someone’s home in these circumstances.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: Now that the coronavirus has gone from an epidemic to a pandemic, and both infections and deaths from the disease are surging across the world and the United States, we return to Times science reporter, Donald G. McNeil Jr., who has covered the story from the start, to understand how to navigate this new reality. It’s Friday, March 13. Hey, Donald.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nHey. How are you?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGood. Welcome back, and thank you for letting us into your home. I know we’ve been hearing a lot from you lately, so let us know if we’re beginning to exhaust your generosity.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nOK. So far, so good.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo far. Key word. Donald, when we first started talking to you about the coronavirus about two weeks ago, you gave us an overview of what it was, where it was headed. Since then, a lot has changed. Given the evolution of the situation, we have questions related to this new phase of the epidemic, now that it’s very much in our lives. I’m working from home. You’re working from home. So let’s start with questions about precautions for people who don’t have the virus — which, presumably, is the vast majority of us at the moment — and how we can protect ourselves from getting the virus. What kind of activities should be avoided right now?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYou have to be aware not only of people around you who are coughing, but you also have to be aware that every — basically every hard surface you touch might potentially have virus on it, unless you know it’s been cleaned since the last person that you don’t know was there might have been on it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLet me tick through a couple of what we imagine, from conversations with everybody on “The Daily” team at The Times, to be the kinds of scenarios I think people want to better understand how to approach. A bit of a lightning round here. Is it dangerous, at this moment, to keep going to work?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nLook, some people are going to have to go to work. Doctors have to go to work. But it’s not so much the danger. The reason the government’s asking people not to go to work is because it creates what they call social distancing. The less interactions there are between people, the less exchange of virus there is. If you slow down the virus, you change what is sometimes called R-naught. And if you get people to be more distant from each other, the virus is transmitted less.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCan you translate that phrase, R-naught?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYeah. It’s called the reproductive number of the virus. It’s, “If I’m sick, how many people am I going to infect?” You never know the real R-naught, or the real fatality rate, or anything about a disease, until it’s completely gone through the world. So we’re never going to know the real answers to these things for at least a year or two, because they’re going to be different in Africa than they are in New York. They’re going to be different anywhere. But if you create more distance between people so that I infect, hopefully, no people, you’ve substantially slowed my part of transmitting the virus. And if you do that across the entire population, you really slow down the movement of that virus in the population. When a lot of people are infected, and a lot of people have pneumonia, a lot of people all need to get to the hospital at the same time. A lot of those people need to get on oxygen or on ventilators, and eventually you run out of ventilators. Then you’re making the triage decisions that they’re now making in northern Italy, which is to say, OK, this is Donald McNeil, 66 years old. I’ve got a choice between saving him or a 25-year-old mother of two. Goodbye, Mr. McNeil. Sorry there isn’t any time for your family to say goodbye to you, because we can’t have visitors, but that’s it. See you later.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSheesh.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWhich is the right thing to do. That’s the right decision for a doctor to make. But those are really tough decisions for doctors.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLet me return to our lightning round that has not yet turned into a lightning round.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nSorry.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBased on some of what you just said, I’m intuiting where this may be headed, but — take the bus or the subway at this moment. Is that wise?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nI don’t think it’s terribly wise. I did it yesterday to get home. I ride the subway standing up with my face close to the vent. I have one glove on my hand, one gardening glove, and I use that if I have to hold onto a rail. The other hand, I make sure, never touches a surface, and I use that for my phone. Mostly, I keep it in my pocket. And I won’t get into a crowded car. I’ll let the train go by.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut if you don’t have to take the subway.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nIf you don’t have to take the subway, don’t.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nStaying on this theme — lots of people are curious about plane travel.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nI would avoid plane travel if I could help it. I have friends who were about to fly to Kentucky to visit their son, and I said, you know what? Why don’t you drive? You know where all the surfaces inside your car have been. You don’t know where all the surfaces inside that plane or that airport have been. I know it’s going to be 11 hours instead of two hours, but I’d say, do it. And that’s what they’re doing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHow about trips to familiar retail establishments — a grocery store, a restaurant?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWell, you have to have food, so go to the grocery store. Be super careful about the handle of the cart, and remember that every box you touch has been placed on that shelf by somebody who might have coughed into their hand. Now, restaurants — I did eat in a restaurant a couple of nights ago. We looked for one that was, really, pretty empty, and we sat at the bar which had just been wiped down. But as this pandemic progresses, I’ll worry more, and I’ll probably avoid going into restaurants.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe gym.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYeah, the gym. I go to a gym. I play squash, which means all I have to touch in common with the other player is the ball, and I know my partner. I would be real reluctant to start grabbing a bunch of weights, not knowing who else had touched them, grabbing a bunch of handles on machines, not knowing who had touched them. I would be reluctant to play basketball with a dozen other guys, because you can’t have 10 guys handling the same ball. If one of them is spewing virus, a virus is going to get on the ball, and then everybody’s got it on their hands.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHow about movies, concerts — things that might be open-air, but where people are sitting quite close to each other?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nOpen-air is safer than enclosed, but even in open-air venues, if you’re sitting on a seat, the handles of the seat might have virus on them. The railings when you walk down to your seat might have virus on them. The ticket taker, as he takes your ticket and hands it back to you — I know it’s paranoid-sounding, but these are all the ways that virus can be transmitted in large gatherings. It’s not just the coughing. It’s the many surfaces that get touched.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn general, I’m hearing you say that going out and interacting with other people poses risks. So I wonder if you can help us understand the calculations behind your thinking in these particular categories. Does it have to do with the lifespan of the virus? Does it have to do with recommendations around social distancing? What is the underlying logic?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes. They’re related to all these things. But I think people get way too obsessive about numbers, about exactly how many hours or days does the virus live on a surface? Exactly how many feet do you have to stand away from somebody else? I mean, you can’t run around through life with a tape measure, trying to figure out, is 3 feet safe enough? Is 6 feet safe enough? But stay away from people who are coughing. Stay away from people who look feverish. And if you have to communicate with somebody, keep your distance. That’s what I’d say. Just generally keep your distance.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou’ve talked about social distancing. How do you socially distance yourself from your family, from your children, from your partner, your spouse, your boyfriend, your girlfriend? Does that really work?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYou can’t. My girlfriend and I still kiss each other. We just trust each other enough to believe we’re not infected. It’s impossible to socially distance yourself from your children. They’re going to come up and hug you. That’s why the whole idea of home quarantine — home isolation, rather — is virtually impossible.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDonald, there’s a strong sense that very young people and people in their teens, 20s, early 30s, are at a much lower risk level for the coronavirus. And I think that’s been borne out. Correct me if I’m wrong. So do all the recommendations that we keep hearing apply as stringently to the young?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes, unless you’re totally selfish.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat you mean?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nDo you have a parent? Do you have a grandparent? Do you want to be the vector that carries that disease to them? Do you know anybody and love anybody who’s older and might be frail? You don’t want your last memory of that person — being that you gave them the virus that killed them. You’ll kick yourself for the rest of your life if you did that. People who were hospitalized in China started at age 30 and went up to 70s and 80s. Yes, on average, the outcomes are better. But if you want something to worry about, you might be the person who doesn’t have a good outcome. You’re spreading a disease to your friends, your social circle. That’s something you ought to feel guilty about. It’s not something you ought to feel indifferent about. People have to take this seriously.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back. We’ve been talking about precautions for people who don’t have the virus and want to keep it that way. I want to turn, now, to what happens if you think you might have the virus. Based on your reporting, and based on the publicly available information, what are the first signs of illness that have been reported and that people, therefore, could be looking out for?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWhat the Chinese found in the large study of the first 45,000 cases is that it’s not like a cold. Fever is the number-one sign. High fever, a dry cough, and then, after that, fatigue. Runny nose was only 4% of cases, and those people might have had flu or a cold at the same time. But there’s something I wanted to say that was important. I described, in our first interview, that 80% of all cases were mild, and the other 20% were either severe or critical. And that stuck in too many people’s minds as if, oh, 80% of cases are practically nothing. You don’t even have it. Maybe it’s asymptomatic. No. That’s wrong. The Chinese study that was based on — everything was either mild, severe, or critical. Mild included everything from “barely any symptoms” to pneumonia, but pneumonia not needing hospitalization or oxygen. Once you stepped over into needing oxygen, then you were severe. Once you were in organ failure, you were critical. So if people think this is a mild disease, get over that idea. I’m sorry if I contributed to the spread of that idea. I should have been much more careful in describing the whole range of symptoms that came under the term “mild.”\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. In other words, “mild” doesn’t necessarily mean mild.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nNothing like what we mean by a mild cold.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhen is it recommended that, no matter how mild or severe the symptoms are, a person be tested? Is there a threshold?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nI don’t know if the authorities have set a threshold yet. I know what happens in pandemics is that, ultimately, you have to assume that a lot of people have the disease. And that really when you reach the point where almost everybody has it, you end up stopping even bothering to test them. You ultimately are going to assume that everybody has it, because it’s the most popular virus going around. If you have no trouble breathing, if you have got a fever that you can handle at home, then stay home and take care of it. Although that’s not the way the Chinese handled it. The Chinese said, if you think you have symptoms — and I hope we get to this point. The Chinese said, if you think you have symptoms, if you think you’re getting sick, get directed to a fever clinic, where somebody who is in protective gear can see you, and they will see you and sort out whether you have bacterial pneumonia, or flu, or whether you have coronavirus. And if you have coronavirus, you’re going to go into isolation with a lot of other people who have coronavirus. Even if you have a very mild case, you’re going to go in with all the other mild cases, because they know cases can crash. It’s a pretty common phenomenon that people are going along OK with some breathing difficulty, and then in the second week, they crash. Their oxygen saturation drops, and they need oxygen. And in those cases, in the isolation centers in China, when you might be in a gymnasium with 1,000 other people, when you crashed, they recognized it right there. There was no wait, and they would move you to a hospital.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThis is a bit of an ethics question, but let’s say you get into a cab, and you’re on your way to get tested for the coronavirus, or you hitch a ride with a friend. Should it be disclosed that you think you might have the virus? Should basically anyone you come in contact with be aware of your status?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes. You’re carrying a potentially lethal disease, so you’ve got to warn other people. There’s no ethical question about this. Unfortunately, this has been the story of I don’t know how many pandemics. How many people have lied about having a sexually transmitted disease, especially in the five minutes right before they thought they were going to get lucky, and if they disclosed what they had, they were going to ruin the moment? Unfortunately, that’s how a whole lot of sexually transmitted diseases, including H.I.V., get passed on. It takes a lot of courage to be that ethical, and I hope during this epidemic, people will.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd the test itself, it remains somewhat scarce, but to the degree you know it, can you describe the test? Is it a saliva swab?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThe point is to get a sample of where the virus is, so there are different ways of getting that swab. Typically, for a while, they were doing nasopharyngeal swabs, which is, basically, pushing a Q-tip so far up your nose that it feels like it’s going into your brain. But I’ve seen swabs that were just taken from the back of the throat. And I know that there are some times, when people are coughing hard, they try to get them to cough up sputum so they can test that. You want to get a sample that’s got virus from where the cells are infected. Originally, it attaches deep in the lungs, so you’re trying to get a sample from there. But once it moves up into your nose and throat, maybe you can get a sample from there. So it’s very dangerous for the person who’s trying to get the Q-tip in, or the sputum sample out, to be standing right in front of them as they do that. They have to be really protected in order to do that safely.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHow long do the results generally seem to be taking for these tests?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nI was told that, in China, when they had the on-the-spot labs and the fever clinics, they could give you an answer in as little as four hours, but that’s ideal. There were others of seven hours. Other times, they had to send it off someplace overnight. Until recently, we’ve been having to send every sample to Atlanta. So that’s several days.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. To the C.D.C.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes, to the C.D.C.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhich is the least efficient version of this, it would seem.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nIt’s the least efficient version, but for a while, it was the only accurate version, and a positive wasn’t considered a positive until the C.D.C. had confirmed it. We’ve got to solve this testing problem. We’ve got to have it so that tests are literally right there, because you’ve got to diagnose people and then isolate them so they don’t go home and give the virus to the family, and they don’t go back to work and give the virus to their coworkers.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd we are not at that phase just yet, are we?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nRight now, we’re not even talking about that phase. That’s how they did it in China. Right now, we’re still talking about home isolation, and the W.H.O., the Chinese, and the South Koreans would say, that doesn’t work. That’s too dangerous. There’s no way you can isolate at home without infecting your family.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe final phase of questions, Donald, are, what happens when a person has been diagnosed with the virus? You’ve told us that there really is no cure for the coronavirus. It’s going to run its course. Are there useful over-the-counter medicines that would help somebody get through this virus?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThis is kind of crazy, because I don’t think it’s safe to think of it as something you can happily stay home with and treat like, oh, I’ve got the flu. You’ve got to be aware that there is the possibility of crashing. You’ve got to have a number you can call. The state should be aware that you’re a patient, that you’re in home quarantine, and there should be somebody checking in on you each day, or you should be checking in with somebody so that they say, how high is your fever? How fast are you breathing?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHow long can a person expect to be sick, once diagnosed?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nMild cases typically resolved themselves in two weeks. People who were on ventilators and in severe situations were usually three to six weeks.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat’s a long time.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYeah. That’s a long time. It’s a long time for one of your ventilators to be in use. Even the severe and the critical cases — most of the time, they ended in good outcomes. But for some people, death took several weeks, too. People didn’t just immediately crash and die. It would be a somewhat slow process.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDonald, once you have this virus, does it confer immunity on getting the coronavirus again in the next couple weeks, next couple of years, forever?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nNobody knows about forever. Virtually all doctors assume that having recovered from this confers immunity, because that’s the norm. When you recover from a disease, you normally have immunity at least for a while.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOnce a person recovers from the virus, is there permanent damage? Do we know?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nSome people who have gone into severe pneumonia or A.R.D.S., adult respiratory distress syndrome, yes, will have permanent damage. They’ll live, but they’ll have permanently damaged lungs. That can definitely happen.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what do we know about how the virus, long-term, affects people who I think would be, justifiably, quite anxious at this moment — pregnant women?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThe small numbers of women that have been studied in China who were pregnant during this relatively short time period — there was a study that came out just a couple of days ago. Nine women all delivered healthy babies. Something like six of the women were delivered by cesarean, which doctors may have chosen to do just for the extra safety of knowing that the baby wasn’t going to be infected in the birth canal. But some of the babies were born naturally, too, and all the babies were healthy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat’s reassuring.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThat’s good news it’s a very small sample, but it’s good news from what we know from the small sample. It’s really different from some other diseases.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFinally, Donald, we want to tackle a few questions that we’ve observed from friends, family and from the internet that may be in the territory of rumor or half-baked theories, but that are gaining some currency. So basically, a true-or-false section here. First off, are there multiple strains of the coronavirus, and are some more dangerous than others?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nNo. There are slightly different variants of the coronavirus — really, variances by a couple of nucleotides. There is no evidence that one is more infectious than the other, or one is more lethal than the other. Not so far, anyway.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNext. This is a seasonal virus, and it will more or less be gone in a few months.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThat would be lovely, but we don’t know that. This is a new virus. We’ve never seen it in summertime, so we don’t know how it’s going to behave in summertime. Respiratory viruses like influenza tend to disappear in the summer. We don’t know what this virus is going to do in the summer, so it’s not a good idea to make predictions. That’s just wishful thinking on the part of people who say, oh, it’s all going to disappear in the summertime.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd the last of these true-of-false questions, Donald. Are the media — we hear this a lot — blowing the scale of this out of proportion, given the relatively small number of infections compared with the overall populations in any given country?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nLook. I ask myself this question every day, because I’m the media in this case. Normally, I get to blame the other jackals of the press for blowing things out of proportion, but this time —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNot this time.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\n— it’s on my shoulders. I’d like to think there’s nothing to worry about. I never worried about Ebola coming to New York. I never worried much about SARS spreading in New York. I worried, in the beginning, about H1N1 flu in 2009, but then, as the mortality data got clearer, I stopped worrying. I knew we’d mostly get it, but I knew it would be, mostly, not a problem. This one, same as I said two-plus weeks ago, really flips me out. This one reminds me of 1918 — a dangerous virus that transmits easily between people. Yes, 80% of the cases are mild, but as I described, “mild” is a term that the Chinese use describing all the way up to pneumonia. That’s not mild. We don’t know what the fatality rate is. It got as high, in some weeks in Wuhan, as 5%. That was during the chaos period in Wuhan. We don’t know what it is in Italy now, and we won’t know, until it’s all over, what the total fatality rate is going to be. I’d love to be told I was wrong, I was an alarmist, I should eat my hat. But we’ll see. So far, I’ve been right about every scary thing I said about this disease. I’ve been worried, ever since I looked at the numbers, about how fast the epidemic was doubling in China, and how fast people were going to hospitals. I sat down and wrote down on a piece of paper about how fast this could double, and I came into work the next day and said, this is going to go pandemic. Originally, nobody believed me, and I had to call 12 different experts and count which ones believed me and which ones didn’t believe me. It came out, basically, eight to two to two. Eight thought it —\n\n[music]\n\n— had the potential to go pandemic, two thought it was overblown, and two didn’t want to comment, didn’t want to take a guess.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like you’re saying, so far, we haven’t blown it out of proportion, and you have been a relatively successful prognosticator of this virus. So that’s why we’re going to keep talking to you about it. I want to tell you how much I appreciate you giving us your time and your wisdom. Thank you.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThank you for inviting me.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOver the coming weeks, we’ll be answering your questions about the coronavirus and how to navigate the pandemic. You can send us your questions by voicemail at 646-598-6012. Be sure to tell us your name and where you’re calling from.

The mathematical model behind this dynamic graph predicts that even with moderate interventions, the death rate can be cut in half. Note that the results of this model are very sensitive to many variables including the distribution of the age of the population, fatality rate, replication rate (number of infected persons per person infected), and hospital capacity. Different assumptions for any of these variables may result in very different outcomes.\n\nThere is another New York Times article “Which Country Has Flattened the Curve for the Coronavirus?” which shows time series graphs of the number of new cases by date for the 73 countries which have more than 50 confirmed cases. (Note that the scales on the graphs vary to make them more readable. For example, the y-axis scale for Vietnam is 0 - 6 new cases, while the scale for Italy is 0 - 3,000 new cases.) You can compare countries’ trajectories of new coronavirus cases. Some countries, including Japan and Korea, have had coordinated national programs of vigilant monitoring and interventions, including travel bans and mandatory quarantines for returning travelers, that have resulted in downturns in the number of new cases.\n\nHow should the United States “flatten the curve?”\n\nThis week, we moderated our five hours and had 654 responses from around the world with over 200 great headlines. Thanks to all students who responded. And, just as importantly, to the students who replied to other students. You made this a community in these times of school closings and social isolation. Here is a small group of catchy headlines that capture the main idea of this graph: “Corona’s Tradeoff: How a Longer ‘Coronacation’ will Prevent Deaths” By Evan of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, “Coronavirus: Protecting More Than Just Our Health.” By Jenna of Pennsylvania, “Refuse Quarantine and We All Suffer the Consequences” by Emily of Melrose High School in Massachusetts, and “Protect Our Healthcare System by Protecting Yourself” by Lilly of New York.\n\nYou may want to think critically about these questions.\n\nBy implementing protective measures, like social distancing and closures of schools and businesses, why would the number of cases at any one-time decrease compared to when there are no protective measures? Why would the length of the epidemic increase when protective measures are implemented?\n\nWhat interventions could be instituted to change the outcomes shown in this graph? Break down your response into what could change the length of the epidemic (“time since first case”), number of infected people (“# of cases”), and number of infected patients that could be treated (“health care system capability”). Which of these changes would be easiest and which would be hardest to implement?\n\nA simulation is a mathematical process that models random events. A random event is an event that is not predictable; that is, you cannot predict its occurrence exactly. Good simulations closely resemble real-world outcomes. The Washington Post published a simulation of the spread of the coronavirus under four levels of intervention: no intervention, forced quarantine, and two levels of social distancing. In the dynamic simulation, you can see the infected members of the population interacting with others, either by staying clear of others or infecting them. The simulations show how the number of healthy, recovered, and sick individuals changes over time. View the article and see the results of these four levels of intervention. Are the curves in the graphs based on the simulations symmetrical as they are in the New York Times graph? If not, why do you think they are not symmetrical? Based on what you see in the simulations, what amount of intervention do you support?\n\nBelow in the Stat Nuggets, we define and explain mathematical terms that apply to the graph.\n\nThank you for participating in “What’s Going On in This Graph?” which is intended to help you think more critically about graphs and the underlying data.

It should be close to 100 percent and any level lower than 95 percent is cause for concern. It took hours to get him stable, and four days in the intensive care unit before we could take him home.\n\nThe shock of that experience makes the threat of this new virus feel uncomfortably close. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the new coronavirus, which causes the disease Covid-19, is so far not infecting children as frequently or severely as adults. No one yet seems to know why, and that’s partly because the virus, which originated in China, is so new. “Most of the information we’re getting is from China,” said Dr. Sharon A. McGrath-Morrow, M.D., a professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University. “But it looks like generally children have been spared the more severe manifestations of this virus.”\n\nFor me — and, I imagine, for many parents of the approximately six million other children in the United States who have asthma — it’s hard to believe that this coronavirus, which targets lung cells, isn’t more dangerous to our kids. So I called Dr. Gwynne Church, M.D., a pediatric pulmonologist at University of California, San Francisco, Benioff Children’s Hospital. She admitted that almost all the research on the new coronavirus so far has been focused on what is leading to severe pneumonia and death, not its effect on common chronic diseases. “It’s reassuring that asthma was not a risk for death with the coronavirus in China,” she said. “But we don’t know that the virus wasn’t leading to sickness causing increased asthma.” It’s an evolving situation, she added, and our populations are not identical.

This is “The Daily.” Today: So far, the United States is losing the battle against the coronavirus. Donald G. McNeil Jr. on what it would take to turn the corner. It’s Tuesday, March 24. Donald, it is now about 4:20 on Monday. Where are we in this pandemic in the United States? How would you characterize it at this moment?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nI would say it’s wildly out of control, but we have not recognized it yet. Certainly wildly out of control in New York State.\n\narchived recording (news anchor) The epicenter in the U.S. is now clearly New York, with more than 12,000 cases, most of them here in New York City.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nIn Washington.\n\narchived recording (news anchor) The state of Washington has the second highest number, with almost 1,000 cases. And then there’s California. We have the third highest number.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nIn northern California, in South Florida.\n\narchived recording (news anchor) We saw pictures of Disney World jam-packed with people, aerial photos of beaches in Florida jammed with people. There are still so many Americans that don’t understand they are spreading the virus.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWe’ve just begun to do tests, really. We’ve got 42,000 positive cases. We’ve got 513 deaths.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYou know, some people have said this is like a war. And it’s as if your army has been marching forward, and the enemy has been shooting at you for two to three weeks now, and nobody has yet looked down to see whether or not they’re bleeding.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nBut very soon, we will see how many people have been hit. Because, you know, you get sick within four, five, six, seven days of getting infected. But usually you don’t need hospitalization — if you’re going to need hospitalization — until about 10 days to two weeks in. It’s known as the second week crash. And some people crash even after they thought they were starting to get better. So we’re facing something like that. A lot of people are sick, huge numbers of people are about to fall seriously ill.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nBut it just hasn’t happened yet.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, I want to talk about what the U.S. government and states have done so far. How would you describe what has been done to try to mitigate this?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nIt’s a giant patchwork across the country.\n\narchived recording (gavin newsom) This is a moment we need to make tough decisions. This is a moment where we need some straight talk, and we need to tell people the truth.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nI mean, you see California ordering people to stay inside their houses.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) So we’re going to put out an executive order today, New York State on pause.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nNew York requesting that people stay inside their houses and closing down all nonessential businesses.\n\narchived recording (news anchor) A stay at home order for all of Ohio.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYou have Ohio and Louisiana —\n\narchived recording (john bel edwards) Today, I’m issuing a stay-at-home at home water for the entire state of Louisiana.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\n— moving in the same direction.\n\narchived recording (john bel edwards) Which will become effective tomorrow Monday, March 23 at 5 p.m.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThe federal government has recommended no gatherings of more than 10 people. Some states are enforcing that even more harshly than that, like California. Other states are setting their own policies.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight, and as patchy and inconsistent as this approach may be, there is beginning to be real blowback to this government-mandated social distancing and shutting down our society, given that it is putting people out of work. It’s closing businesses. The president has said just in the past few hours —\n\narchived recording (donald trump) We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself. We’re not gonna let the cure be worse than the problem.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHe doesn’t want the cure to be worse than the illness itself. So I want to understand why we’re pursuing this approach rather than a variety of alternatives. And let’s start with the South Korean approach, right? Not closing all businesses, not closing all restaurants, focusing instead on aggressively tracking the sick and testing as many people as possible. And it seems to be working, right? So why can’t we do that here? Why isn’t that a viable alternative to shutting things down?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWell, we could do that here, if we had a time machine and we could travel back in time to about January 20, because January 15 is where we know one of the first cases arrived in the United States and started spreading. That was the case in Washington. The idea that we could try to start cracking down now, when we have over 40,000 cases and 500 deaths, it’s just utterly impossible. It’s not close to anything that South Korea faced. I mean, South Korea, they were doing this kind of crackdown when they first saw cases arriving, before there was a single death. So we’re just behind the eight ball on that kind of thinking. And mostly they had small scattered cases, and then they had this gigantic explosion inside one church. I think it was more than 500 cases inside that church. All right, they managed to do contact tracing on 210,000 members of that church. Los Angeles just gave up contact tracing today.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nJust knowing that they don’t have the tests to do it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMeaning, tracing those who were in contact with somebody who has tested positive.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nTracing everybody who was in contact with somebody who was tested positive. Not only everybody they’ve been in contact with since they knew they were infected, but everybody even 48 hours before that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo not only is it too late to follow the South Korean model, you’re saying, as an alternative in the U.S., we just don’t have the capacity or the resources to follow it.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nCorrect.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK, so we can dispense with that. Another possible alternative to just shutting everything down is isolating the most vulnerable in American society to the coronavirus. So the elderly, those with pre-existing conditions, underlying medical problems, rather than asking everyone to isolate in some form or another. And in that scenario, most Americans would be treated as we treat most Americans during the regular flu season, right? Take some precautions, be careful but don’t fundamentally alter your life. And there are doctors who seem to be advocating for this “isolate the most vulnerable” scenario. And one of our colleagues, columnist Tom Friedman, gave voice to their views over the weekend. And it seems President Trump is interested in this kind of a concept. What do the experts that you have talked to say about the viability of that?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThis was an idea that was floated for a while in the Netherlands, and was floated for a while in the U.K., and dropped because they realized that it was ridiculous. Why is it ridiculous? One, how do you only isolate the elderly?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nElderly people in this country very often live with their families. Elderly people need services, which people deliver to them in their houses. Or they go to community centers, or to their relatives houses for services they absolutely need, from everything from food to company. How do you isolate the vulnerable? How do you isolate everybody who’s obese in this country?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhy do you mention obese?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nBecause many have diabetes. And diabetes is one of the conditions that renders you more susceptible to dying of this disease. Everybody who’s got high blood pressure, not all high blood pressure but uncontrolled high blood pressure, which a lot of people do in this country, is more susceptible to this disease. Anybody who’s taken any sort of immunosuppressive drugs or is fairly recently beyond cancer treatment may be more susceptible to this disease.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThere’s some data suggesting now that people who vape may be more susceptible to developing pneumonia from this disease. Vaping is not something that’s common among the elderly in this country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you’re saying, there are just too many vulnerable populations for this to be practical?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes. So the idea that you can just isolate all the most vulnerable people in the U.S. is simply wishful thinking.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo given that, Donald, I want to talk through another possible alternative, one that President Trump seems to be talking up a lot in the past couple of days.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) It’s a common malaria drug. It’s been available, so therefore the safety level we understand very well. It’s been relatively safe.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhich is the idea that we are close to a treatment to the coronavirus, something that would reliably combat it, and mean that we don’t need to shut down societies.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) We’re also studying this and other promising therapies, which is a therapy produced by Gilead. And that would be rems — it’s called remdesivir, remdesivir — and it shows great promise.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo tell me about these drugs that President Trump has been referring to and whether he is right to suggest that they might be a solution here.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nOK. The drugs that President Trump has mentioned over the past week are chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which are two versions of a longstanding malaria drug. Goes back 70 years. And the other drug is called remdesivir, and it’s a drug made by Gilead, and it doesn’t actually have any use. I think they may have hoped it would work against H.I.V., and it didn’t. It definitely did not work against Ebola when they tried it. Now they’re hoping it works against coronavirus. There’s some evidence to suggest it does. I mean, there’s evidence in animal testing to suggest that both of these drugs might possibly work.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThose drugs have been used in China. But this was by doctors who were desperate, who were basically throwing everything they had at patients.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nAnd in some cases, where doctors had a certain number of patients that said, gee, these patients seemed to do better when I gave them that drug. Now, that doesn’t mean this was some sort of Lazarus-like rise from your hospital bed and walk away smiling miracle drug. This was a drug that seemed to let these patients have better outcomes. But they weren’t able to do, for several reasons, real clinical trials, where you have two groups of patients who are basically exactly equal to each other and half of them get the drug and half don’t. That’s what you need in order to be sure that a drug really works. Once you license a drug, then doctors start giving it all over the place. Actually, chloroquine is already licensed, so doctors are giving it in the hopes that it will work, and patients are demanding it in the belief that it will work, the belief partially spread by the president. And we don’t really know how well it works. And these drugs are not completely safe. They shouldn’t be taken, especially by children, without medical supervision. And the fear is that false hopes will be raised. And that also people get so excited about it that some may start taking the drugs to protect themselves out of fear, if they’ve managed to get a hold of a bottle, and they may end up poisoning their kids. These are bad outcomes. There is a case where the cure is worse than the disease.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo beyond the fact that there’s not yet enough medical evidence that this is a legitimate set of treatments, there’s potentially real medical risk in people starting to take them, because they might actually make people sick.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK, so with all those options basically deemed impractical, that would seem to bring us back to social isolation. But is that working? Because my sense is, so far in the United States, it is not working.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nNo, it’s not working. And that’s because we’re not doing it right. And, you know, to write the articles I’ve been writing recently, I talked to a dozen top experts, not just at the World Health Organization, but people who run medical schools, people who have fought pandemics, people who fought Ebola, people fought SARS, people who fought MERS. And they say that if we’re going to get a grip on our epidemic, we have to imitate China, because we’ve got China-like spread. We’re not going to be able to catch it up with a South Korea-like program, and we’re going to have to do a whole lot better than Italy and Iran did. And we’re not on that track right now.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back. So if the U.S. is failing at social isolation, what would the ideal version of social isolation look like right now? What would it entail?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nSo in an ideal world, if you could wave a magic wand and make everybody in the United States freeze in place, sitting six feet apart from each other for two weeks —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\n— we could stop the epidemic in two weeks. If we had enough —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nReally?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYeah, because within two weeks, the virus would die out on every surface that it was. People wouldn’t be interacting, so they wouldn’t transmit it. And everybody who has symptoms, the symptoms turn up in two weeks at the most. So you’d know who was sick. And even for the few asymptomatics, you’d be able to find them by doing tests. And so that’d be it. Epidemic over. I mean, you’d have a lot of people in the hospitals, but that would be the end of it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nKnowing that we don’t have a magic wand but wish we did, what do we do? What’s the playbook for how to keep people away from each other in the United States, given where the virus is?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nAs much as possible, we have to stop everything in places where we know the virus is. That is what China did. They knew the virus was incredibly hot in Wuhan and the surrounding province, and so they put that entire province on lockdown. Unfortunately, that means not just stopping all air travel, it means basically stopping all travel.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nI mean, people can’t be together on buses. People can’t be together on planes. People can’t be together in cars, unless it’s just them and they’re going to socially isolate together when they get to the end of their journey, and stay in place for, unfortunately, an indefinite amount of time. The loosey goosier the freeze is, the longer it lasts. And the longer it’s going to take us to get our economy started again. Because the looser it is, the more transmission there is. The more transmission there is, the more people end up overcrowding hospitals. The more people overcrowd hospitals, the more people die.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK, so that’s transportation. And you’re suggesting that, in many ways, we have to further restrict that. What about businesses? What about restaurants all over the country? Do they need to be shut down?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes, all of these things. Transportation, restaurants all over the country, schools all over the country, workplaces all over the country, bars and restaurants all over the country. And different places are turning into hotspots spots even as we speak, because people are now traveling all over the country and still spreading the virus, starting new clusters. The only way to get on top of this disease is to stop the clusters.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn this scenario that you’re describing, what can be open? What’s an acceptable reason for anyone to be out and about?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nDoctors, nurses, people who work in the health care field. Police, fire, the people who keep the water mains open and the electrical grid running and Wi-Fi reaching houses. And food delivery and medicine delivery. That’s the ideal. Those are the only people who are allowed out and that keep the country functioning. We need people to freeze in place, and we need to make sure they have enough calories and water and medicine to stay alive.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYou know, not that they are worried about how their business is running and how their investments are going or whether or not they’re collecting their rents. And we have to do things like tell landlords that they can’t collect their rents, tell banks that they can’t collect their mortgages. The idea is to keep the country alive until the virus slows down. It may be impossible, but if you want to try to use any sort of social distancing tactic, it has to be much more intense than it is now, because we’re not slowing the virus. It’s still spreading wildly.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd this slowdown, how would it be enforced in a place like the United States? Let’s say that suddenly every state, every mayor locks down a community along the lines of what experts say needs to be done now to freeze this in place. How does it actually get enforced? Who is in charge of punishing those who violate it, roaming the streets and making sure it actually happens?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWell, I mean, legally you can do it. The governor and the health commissioner have the power to use the police to enforce these laws. In Italy, as in China, they went to roadblocks everywhere. You couldn’t drive down a street without a permit that had been issued by the government that said, I’m an emergency worker. I am allowed to drive down the street. That’s what will have to happen if people don’t do it voluntarily, and I fully expect that Americans are not going to do this voluntarily. But then we’re going to suffer the consequences.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what happens if we don’t do all the things that experts are saying we must do, the social isolation, the lockdowns? I mean, it doesn’t seem we’re headed there. So what happens if we don’t implement any of these measures?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nIf we don’t implement these measures, we will have a Wuhan in New York, and a Wuhan in Seattle, and a Wuhan in South Florida, and a Wuhan in Wheeling West, Virginia, and a Wuhan in Helena, Montana, and so on.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nBecause hospitals will get overwhelmed everywhere. And in Wuhan, in the early weeks of the epidemic, the death rate was 4 percent to 6 percent. It’s a little unclear, because there were people who couldn’t make it to the hospitals and just died at home. But if you go on the South China Morning Post site and you look for the videos that were shot then, you’ll see hospitals with people crowded in the corridors and literally dead bodies lying in the halls, that nobody’s had time to take away. You’ll see nurses and doctors screaming, having breakdowns, screaming in frustration, I can’t take it anymore, I can’t take it anymore. You will see lines of coffins outside the crematories, just sitting there waiting for their turn to go into the furnace, because there’s too many coffins for the flames to burn fast enough. I mean, we have seen that in Wuhan and we’ve seen it in Italy, where they were having to stack coffins on the pews of the churches that had been closed down, because there was no place to put the coffins and they couldn’t dig graves fast enough. So that’s what we’re headed for.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI mean, it’s horrific.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. And we’ve — I’ve been looking at this stuff since late January, early February, and frightened by it. The visions are nightmarish, and I don’t see anybody taking it seriously. But that’s what we’re headed for.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt’s kind of hard to process this, because what you’re suggesting is that a short term, essentially, shutdown down of much of our life in the U.S. would potentially bring this whole pandemic to an end. And yet there are a lot of practical reasons why that would be very, very hard to imagine. But for those who are very skeptical of it, and who think, as the president said, that the cure may be worse than the illness, it would seem like a short-term version of this would be kind of ideal, right? Because it would happen —\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWho said short-term? I said if there were a magic wand, you could do a short-term shutdown. I think for the shutdown to be effective, given how lax Americans are about staying in the shutdown, we have got to have a shutdown that lasts for months and months.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo there’s no short-term version of this, given the way the U.S. operates.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThere’s no magic wand. There’s no 15-day cure.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat’s pretty depressing, because it means that there’s almost nothing we can do right now. That the genie is out of the bottle, the horses have left the barn, the pandemic is too deeply in our system.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nIn New York, I think that’s true. We don’t know exactly how many people have been infected, but we know that it’s been incredibly hot with virus out there for awhile now. And yet people are really struggling, because, you know, they haven’t had their Rock Hudson, ‘here’s somebody I know who’s got the disease, so now I believe in it,’ moments. People are still — they’re beginning to hear about colleagues who were sick, colleagues who were infected and stuff, but that only began four or five days ago. People beginning to need to be hospitalized in large numbers is usually 10 days, and the deaths don’t usually take place until three to six weeks. So we have a lot more pain in the future.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut is it possible for other cities in the U.S. — smaller cities, maybe even mid-sized cities, not New York, not Seattle, maybe not Los Angeles — to do these things and spare themselves?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes. And it will take those Bruegelesque visions of New York to convince them that this is what’s headed their way.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nAnd maybe they’ll take the actions they need to. And maybe they won’t.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI’m thinking back to the phrase you used to describe the way the United States is handling this right now — as a patchwork. Do you think, Donald, that we are going to be ending up in a kind of awful middle place, where many of us are at home, we are isolating in lots of big parts of the country, but it’s not enforced significantly enough and uniformly enough to have meaningful impact? And so rather than having the magic wand version of this, we have the worst version of this, which is, there’s a lot of burdens, social and economic, and still the virus keeps spreading and spreading.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes, I think that’s exactly what’s going to happen. There’s going to be a great deal of economic impact, but we’re not going to be able to find the political will or the fear as a people to shut down the spread of the virus. I don’t see us flattening the curve, as everybody has talked about. Maybe some other cities will be able to flatten the curve later. Once they see what’s going to happen in New York, they’ll begin to believe that they have to flatten the curve, and they’ll go in. But then you’ll find out how many people were infected in the meantime. I mean, we’re going to come out of this as a different nation, a different people. If we essentially don’t shut down so that the chain of transmissions don’t stop, we’re going to be looking at hundreds of thousands of dead, I think, unless some drug turns out to be a miracle preventive. And that’s the high hope for the chloroquine, but we don’t really know that yet. And we know there’s not going to be a vaccine for a year. So short of that, we may have to shelter in place for a year until a vaccine rolls out. Look, I hope for better.\n\n[music]\n\nBut I’m not trying to sugarcoat it. I’m trying to explain what the worst case scenario is. I hope we don’t reach the worst case scenario, but I fear that we are a long way down the road towards it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, I would like to say thank you, Donald, but it just doesn’t seem like that kind of a conversation. Thank you, anyway. We appreciate it.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThank you. Sorry. I’d love to be proved wrong.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday, during his daily briefing on the pandemic, President Trump continued to promote medications that have not been widely proven as effective in treating the disease and said that thousands of doses of one of them — chloroquine — would be distributed to New York City despite misgivings from federal health officials.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) America will again, and soon, be open for business. Very soon.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAt the same time, the president said that he was eager to quickly end the economic shutdown now in place to halt the spread of the virus, in defiance of advice from his medical advisers.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Our country wasn’t built to be shut down. This is not a country that was built for this.

The new coronavirus spreads at its quickest in closed environments. And places like nursing homes in affected areas have begun to take precautions at the behest of families and experts. As this new disease spreads, it has become equally important for all of us to ask what steps are being taken to protect the health of people in jails and prisons, and the staff who work in them.\n\nThe American criminal legal system holds almost 2.3 million people in prisons, jails, detention centers and psychiatric hospitals. And they do not live under quarantine: jails experience a daily influx of correctional staff, vendors, health care workers, educators and visitors — all of whom carry viral conditions at the prison back to their homes and communities and return the next day packing the germs from back home. How will we prevent incarcerated people and those who work in these institutions from becoming ill and spreading the virus?\n\nThis week, the Harris County Juvenile Court in Houston announced that the court wing will be fully closed to all until further notice, after officials reported that a person who had been in the court may test positive for coronavirus. And an employee at a correctional facility in Pennsylvania also tested positive for Covid-19. Thirty-four inmates and staffers there are now in quarantine. On Friday, the Federal Department of Correction announced that incarcerated people at all 122 federal correctional facilities across the country will not be allowed visits from family, friends or attorneys for 30 days, in response to the threat of the coronavirus. But this ethical sacrifice raises more questions than it answers about the broader set of changes that will be required to limit this contagion while protecting the rights of incarcerated people.\n\nIn America’s jails and prisons, people share bathrooms, laundry and eating areas. The toilets in their cells rarely have lids. The toilet tank doubles as the sink for hand washing, tooth brushing and other hygiene. People bunked in the same cell — often as many as four — share these toilets and sinks. Meanwhile, hand sanitizer is not allowed in most prisons because of its alcohol content.

Stocks of the critical gear are disappearing during the coronavirus pandemic. Doctors say they are rationing gloves, reusing masks and raiding hardware stores. The C.D.C. has even said that scarves or bandannas can be used as protection as a last resort. “I’ve met the doctors, and talked with them every day. I think there’s an interesting challenge here in that, currently, there’s such a need that if they had anything, they would deploy it.” The cries for help are mobilizing a wide range of innovators, some of them even joining forces through online messaging platforms like Slack. These are engineers, doctors and even high school students from around the world. They come from all walks of life, but say their goal is the same. “It’s amazing because no one’s asking which country are you from? They’re just like, how can I help? What do you need?” They’re pitching in by crowdsourcing designs for masks, face shields and even ventilators that could be reproduced around the world. This is Nick Moser. He’s an active player in one of the maker groups. His day job is at a design studio. Now, he’s designing replicable face masks. “We’re focused on three products: a face shield, a cloth mask and an alternative to N95-rated respirators. The face shield is the first line of defense for medical workers. It protects against droplets. If a patient coughs, it’ll hit the face shield rather than them.” Some designs are produced using 3-D printers or laser cutters. “There you go.” Then, the prototypes are field-tested by health care workers. Even some university labs are experimenting with DIY techniques. A group at Georgia Tech is working with open-source designs from the internet to develop products. “My lab works in the area of frugal science, and we build low-cost tools for resource-limited areas. And now, we’ve realized that I don’t have to go that far. It’s in our backyard, right? We need it now. So this is a plastic sheet I have — not too different from what you would get out from a 2-liter Coke or a soda bottle. I actually bought this from an art store. It’s just sheets of PET, so we can cut these out. We are calling this an origami face shield, and it’s the Level 1 protection. This is one idea. There are multiple different prototypes.” “This headband can be reused, and a doctor or nurse could just basically tear this off and basically snap another one on. We’re hearing that, in some cases, that they go through close to 2,000 of these a day.” Because the need is growing so rapidly, the makers are also thinking about how to increase their production. “So how do we get from this one that someone made at home on a laser cutter or a 3-D printer, and then get it in the hands of thousands of doctors and front-line workers?” They’re working with mass manufacturers that can take their tested designs, and replicate them at a larger scale. “We’ve been on the phone talking to a number of suppliers, material suppliers. So I think one of the neat things that we’ve done is not only the design, proving that you can make it rapidly, but then also trying to secure the entire supply chains.” This is Dr. Susan Gunn, whose hospital system in New Orleans has even started its own initiative to 3-D print equipment. “So it starts with an idea. We put the idea into place. And then we make sure that it’s professional-grade first. Infection control is looking at it, and we’re making sure that we’re using the correct materials that would be approved by the C.D.C. and the World Health Organization.” Dr. Gunn says the gear is a safe alternative for those who might otherwise face a shortage. “We’re creating face shields and we’re creating these different PPEs, and we’re putting them in the hands where people felt like they needed them.” Another critical piece of equipment is the N95 mask, and the supply is dwindling fast. Nick and his team are designing a robust alternative for this mask that can hold any filter material, and be mass produced. “It is easily printable. This one is used in medical situations where there’s an actively infectious patient. So nursing homes or obviously I.C.U. units would be the target to receive these.” “These are really hard objects to manufacture because you’re going to give it to a nurse, and then I want to be really confident that it will not let a virus through, right?” This equipment is not approved by federal agencies, but the designers are testing their respirator prototypes for safety. “That was basically the first, almost the first question that was asked. Can we do anything that’s actually going to be safe and helpful?” Some makers are pursuing even more ambitious projects. An engineer named Stephen Robinson in New Haven, Conn., is working on designing ventilators to help patients breathe. Countries are facing a dire shortage of the lifesaving machines. Right now, these DIY ventilators are still prototypes. “So really, this should be thought of as the seed of an idea that could potentially be grown with, and absolutely requiring, the medical and the tech communities.” But they could become key if critical supplies run out. “We’re in very uncertain times, and I see explorations and projects as kind of an insurance policy that could potentially be leaned on if there was extreme circumstances.” Health care workers are hopeful that these efforts could prevent an even worse outcome. “We don’t want anybody — let’s be clear — to use a bandanna to protect themselves. I hope it never gets to the point where we have to wear a bandanna. And I don’t think, with this initiative that we will get there.” For innovators like Saad, the challenge is personal. “I just can’t stop. I have to do stuff. And then I’m currently at a hospital. That’s why I have this uplifting little flower portrait.

Some countries responded slowly to the coronavirus threat because they deemed it a condition primarily lethal to old people “less worthy of the best efforts to contain it,” the World Health Organization’s director general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, noted recently. That some of the national leaders abiding by this assessment are themselves in the highest risk group is testament to one of the fundamental truths of ageism: that it is pervasive among old people themselves in ways that threaten both personal and national health.\n\nThe news and social media have been full of similarly counterproductive messages, even cruel memes such as “Boomer Remover,” a descendant of last year’s dismissive and condescending “OK, Boomer.”\n\nThis matters in the era of Covid-19 because in a culture that persists in ignoring the last century’s huge gains in longevity and the obvious differences between young and much older adults, we are unable to address the needs of older Americans. It matters because the isolation necessary for slowing the rate of contagion will also cause irreparable harm to their health and have both short- and long-term economic effects. And it matters because when we accept the second-class citizenship of an entire category of human being, we set a precedent for treating others with the same disregard.\n\nThe effects of this isolation are being seen throughout the country. On Twitter, a young woman in Oregon described being called over to a car at her supermarket where a couple in their 80s sat scared to go inside lest they become infected; they handed her $100 to do their shopping so that they wouldn’t starve. One of my geriatrics colleagues who cares for people in assisted living facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area told me one patient had commented that his current living situation was “like being in solitary confinement and we have no idea for how long.” A photo picked up by many news outlets shows a Connecticut man holding a sign outside his wife’s nursing home window that said: “I’ve loved you 67 years and still do. Happy anniversary.”\n\nIsolation and neglect add to a history of systematic injury. The Trump administration didn’t just eliminate the federal office of pandemic preparedness and dismiss or drive away scientists and experts at all levels of government; it also moved to decrease nursing home oversight and infection-control regulations. Meanwhile, although I could cite abundant data on the poor quality of many nursing homes and on the ubiquity of loneliness, neglect and mistreatment, and I could note that the facility in Kirkland, Wash., that responded so slowly to a lethal contagion had a top government rating, it is more compelling to simply ask: If you don’t already live in a nursing home, are you looking forward to the time when you can move into one?", "location": ["Wash.", "Connecticut", "Indiana", "Maine", "Oregon", "Kirkland", "The San Francisco Bay Area"], "gpt_analysis": {"tone": "tragic", "framing": "systemic injustice", "group_mentions": ["elderly", "national leaders", "young adults"], "metaphors": ["second-class citizenship", "solitary confinement"], "euphemisms": ["Boomer Remover"], "absences": ["poverty", "racism", "long COVID", "workplace safety", "healthcare access"], "grief_handling": "communal", "blame_or_agency": "The article assigns responsibility to systemic ageism, national leaders, and the Trump administration for inadequate responses and policies.", "commodification_of_death": "The article treats death as a political talking point, highlighting systemic failures and ageism."}}, {"headline": "As China Clamps Down on Negative News, Quarantines ...", "source": "The New York Times", "publish_date": "Mar 12, 2020", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/world/asia/coronavirus-china.html", "article_text": "It started with a stubborn cough, a visit to an urgent care facility and a test being sent off to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

While that is higher than the rate for seasonal flu (0.1 percent), it’s much lower than the staggering rate we saw in the 1918 influenza pandemic (2.5 percent in the United States, and in some nations higher). It may even fall lower once we have a better sense of the number of mild cases.

For example, my colleagues and I observed the use of school closings and other NPIs during the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic. During the first days of the outbreak in Mexico, the Health Ministry conducted a broad-based and exacting group of NPIs, similar to the ones we found worked in 1918.

Eighty-three percent of those closings occurred long after the virus had reached its peak week of infection and had already spread widely among people living in those school districts. The results were all too predictable: The late, reactive school closings had little effect on levels of influenza-like illnesses.\n\nThere’s no reason to close schools in communities that have not yet seen Covid-19.

Many people who do service jobs like cashiers and fast-food workers face elevated risks. Walmart, Starbucks and Uber are among the many companies that have had workers fall sick.\n\nSchool systems around the country have been closing. Teachers rate high both for exposure to illnesses and for their proximity to other people.\n\nFirst responders are also at high risk. Firefighters who responded to calls at the Washington nursing home are under extended quarantines . Paramedics across the country are taking extra precautions when responding to a possible coronavirus case.\n\nPersonal care aides and home health aides who work with the elderly — the population most susceptible to the illness — are also vulnerable. At a nursing home in Washington State linked to 25 coronavirus deaths as of Saturday, at least 70 employees have fallen sick .\n\nHealth care workers are at the greatest risk — they can encounter diseases and infections daily and typically work in close proximity to one another and their patients. Many are already under quarantine because of exposure to the virus.\n\nThe vertical position of each bubble is a measure of how often workers in a given profession are exposed to disease and infection .\n\nEach bubble on this chart represents an occupation.

The database assigns dozens of scores to each occupation for things like how often a telephone is used to how often a job requires you to bend your body. (Housekeepers rank highest in this metric.)\n\nAs virus cases have grown, many businesses have begun closing offices and stores, and sending workers home to help slow the spread. While many companies have emergency leave policies in place to help protect their employees, there are large portions of the population that have few protections.

The small percentage of cases that do require such services are highly concentrated among those age 60 and older, and further so the older people are.

That’s why it is also critical to fund and implement the safety measures necessary to let Americans get back to work, school and play without a recrudescence of the virus.\n\nIn fact, a nationwide lockdown should be seen as only the first step in a long fight that will proceed at a different pace in different parts of the country. In New York, where doctors and nurses dressed in trash bags and bandannas are desperately fighting to contain the virus even as bodies pile up, the crisis is upon us. In three weeks, when case counts in New York may be peaking, outbreaks in other parts of the country might just be entering a phase of deadly exponential growth. The virus may complicate matters even further by receding in late spring or summer, only to re-emerge in the fall or winter.\n\nWe need to prepare for what’s ahead.\n\nTest, Test, Test\n\nThe virus will almost certainly re-emerge as individual states and cities start to lift the strictures of social distancing and shelter-in-place — but, ideally, that re-emergence will look more like a string of smaller brush fires than one raging forest fire. Health officials will not be able to detect those brush fires, or keep them from growing, without diagnostic tests. They will need enough tests both to survey the population at random and to diagnose patients who experience symptoms. They will also need the capacity to isolate those who test positive, and to identify, quarantine and monitor their contacts. If those contacts develop symptoms, they’ll need to be able to test them, too.\n\nTo build such capacity, the federal government will have to invest in the nation’s undervalued and deeply strained public health system: more funding will be crucial, but it will not be enough. State and federal leaders should work together, now, to create a public works corps to assist epidemiologists with contact tracing, to erect thousands of drive-through testing sites, and to do the work of infection control in nursing homes and homeless shelters. Some states are already doing this on their own, but others will need federal funding — perhaps in the form of block grants.\n\nAntibody tests, which can determine whether someone has been exposed to the virus and may therefore be immune, will help get people back to work safely, allowing individuals and public health authorities to gauge who can proceed without worry, and who needs to take additional precautions.

More than 100,000 people across more than 80 countries have been infected with the new virus — and more than 3,400 of them have died, including at least 14 in the United States.\n\nProponents of closed borders and small social safety nets have a tendency to highlight the tension between citizen and noncitizen, to imply or explicitly state that the only way to help one group is to deprive the other. But the truth is, people on both sides are hanging by a thread.\n\nInfectious diseases, especially those like Covid-19, have a knack for penetrating and exposing such false dichotomies. Already, citizens who are underinsured or uninsured are being slammed with medical bills that they can’t afford when they seek testing and treatment for the virus. Unsurprisingly, experts say that many of them are bound to avoid such care as the outbreak rages on. If quarantines become routine, tens of millions of low-wage workers, many of whom don’t have health insurance or paid sick leave, will not be able to stock up and stay home. One shudders to think what will happen if the courts dismantle the Affordable Care Act in the next year — a move that could ultimately leave 21 million or so more people without health insurance.\n\nAmong noncitizens, the effects of the public charge rule and other fear-based immigration policies have long been apparent. New mothers are turning away free baby formula. Hungry families are turning away food assistance. The chronically and even fatally ill are avoiding hospitals and rejecting medical care. In 2019, The Atlantic reported that at least 200 eligible families in a Virginia county had stopped accepting WIC and that many were also turning down reduced-price lunches. Both of those programs are exempted from the public charge rule — using them will not count against a person’s visa or green card application — but those families were too afraid to chance it.\n\nIt’s easy to see how all this fear might feed on itself in the months ahead and also where that might lead. If citizens struggling to cover their own health care nurture resentments against any group perceived to be getting help to which they themselves are not entitled — or worse, if they grow xenophobic and subscribe to the notion that immigrants carry diseases — they might be compelled to endorse policies even more draconian than those already in play. That would create more anxiety among noncitizen communities, which would lead to fewer people seeking medical care when they need it.

Any seal is bound to be imperfect, observers argue, and such measures will only delay the inevitable.\n\nThe select board of North Haven, an island in Maine’s Penobscot Bay that is reachable only by boat or aircraft, said that it struggled with the decision made on Sunday night that limits access to year-round residents, but that it did not have the resources to handle even a few cases.", "location": ["Atlantic", "United States", "Maine", "North Haven", "Oregon", "Indiana"], "gpt_analysis": {"tone": "neutral", "framing": "inevitable", "group_mentions": ["year-round residents", "tourists"], "metaphors": ["insurance", "seal"], "euphemisms": [], "absences": ["healthcare access", "elderly", "racial minorities", "working-class", "poverty"], "grief_handling": "absent", "blame_or_agency": "The article suggests that the islands\' actions are a necessary response to limited resources, implying that the situation is unavoidable rather than assigning blame.", "commodification_of_death": "The article treats the potential for COVID deaths as a risk to be managed, akin to an economic or logistical challenge."}}]
