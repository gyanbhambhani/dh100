    "article_text": "Health care workers around the world are asking for help. “What do you want?” “PPE.” “When do you need it?” “Now.” They’re in desperate need of more PPE, also known as personal protective equipment. Stocks of the critical gear are disappearing during the coronavirus pandemic. Doctors say they are rationing gloves, reusing masks and raiding hardware stores. The C.D.C. has even said that scarves or bandannas can be used as protection as a last resort. “I’ve met the doctors, and talked with them every day. I think there’s an interesting challenge here in that, currently, there’s such a need that if they had anything, they would deploy it.” The cries for help are mobilizing a wide range of innovators, some of them even joining forces through online messaging platforms like Slack. These are engineers, doctors and even high school students from around the world. They come from all walks of life, but say their goal is the same. “It’s amazing because no one’s asking which country are you from? They’re just like, how can I help? What do you need?” They’re pitching in by crowdsourcing designs for masks, face shields and even ventilators that could be reproduced around the world. This is Nick Moser. He’s an active player in one of the maker groups. His day job is at a design studio. Now, he’s designing replicable face masks. “We’re focused on three products: a face shield, a cloth mask and an alternative to N95-rated respirators. The face shield is the first line of defense for medical workers. It protects against droplets. If a patient coughs, it’ll hit the face shield rather than them.” Some designs are produced using 3-D printers or laser cutters. “There you go.” Then, the prototypes are field-tested by health care workers. Even some university labs are experimenting with DIY techniques. A group at Georgia Tech is working with open-source designs from the internet to develop products. “My lab works in the area of frugal science, and we build low-cost tools for resource-limited areas. And now, we’ve realized that I don’t have to go that far. It’s in our backyard, right? We need it now. So this is a plastic sheet I have — not too different from what you would get out from a 2-liter Coke or a soda bottle. I actually bought this from an art store. It’s just sheets of PET, so we can cut these out. We are calling this an origami face shield, and it’s the Level 1 protection. This is one idea. There are multiple different prototypes.” “This headband can be reused, and a doctor or nurse could just basically tear this off and basically snap another one on. We’re hearing that, in some cases, that they go through close to 2,000 of these a day.” Because the need is growing so rapidly, the makers are also thinking about how to increase their production. “So how do we get from this one that someone made at home on a laser cutter or a 3-D printer, and then get it in the hands of thousands of doctors and front-line workers?” They’re working with mass manufacturers that can take their tested designs, and replicate them at a larger scale. “We’ve been on the phone talking to a number of suppliers, material suppliers. So I think one of the neat things that we’ve done is not only the design, proving that you can make it rapidly, but then also trying to secure the entire supply chains.” This is Dr. Susan Gunn, whose hospital system in New Orleans has even started its own initiative to 3-D print equipment. “So it starts with an idea. We put the idea into place. And then we make sure that it’s professional-grade first. Infection control is looking at it, and we’re making sure that we’re using the correct materials that would be approved by the C.D.C. and the World Health Organization.” Dr. Gunn says the gear is a safe alternative for those who might otherwise face a shortage. “We’re creating face shields and we’re creating these different PPEs, and we’re putting them in the hands where people felt like they needed them.” Another critical piece of equipment is the N95 mask, and the supply is dwindling fast. Nick and his team are designing a robust alternative for this mask that can hold any filter material, and be mass produced. “It is easily printable. This one is used in medical situations where there’s an actively infectious patient. So nursing homes or obviously I.C.U. units would be the target to receive these.” “These are really hard objects to manufacture because you’re going to give it to a nurse, and then I want to be really confident that it will not let a virus through, right?” This equipment is not approved by federal agencies, but the designers are testing their respirator prototypes for safety. “That was basically the first, almost the first question that was asked. Can we do anything that’s actually going to be safe and helpful?” Some makers are pursuing even more ambitious projects. An engineer named Stephen Robinson in New Haven, Conn., is working on designing ventilators to help patients breathe. Countries are facing a dire shortage of the lifesaving machines. Right now, these DIY ventilators are still prototypes. “So really, this should be thought of as the seed of an idea that could potentially be grown with, and absolutely requiring, the medical and the tech communities.” But they could become key if critical supplies run out. “We’re in very uncertain times, and I see explorations and projects as kind of an insurance policy that could potentially be leaned on if there was extreme circumstances.” Health care workers are hopeful that these efforts could prevent an even worse outcome. “We don’t want anybody — let’s be clear — to use a bandanna to protect themselves. I hope it never gets to the point where we have to wear a bandanna. And I don’t think, with this initiative that we will get there.” For innovators like Saad, the challenge is personal. “I just can’t stop. I have to do stuff. And then I’m currently at a hospital. That’s why I have this uplifting little flower portrait. We’re expecting a baby boy, and what do we tell him when he grows up about what we did when society needed us?”",

    "article_text": "[Machine beeping] “The frustrating thing about all of this is it really just feels like it’s too little, too late. Like we knew — we knew it was coming. Today is kind of getting worse and worse. We had to get a refrigerated truck to store the bodies of patients who are dying. We are, right now, scrambling to try to get a few additional ventilators or even CPAP machines. If we could get CPAP machines, we could free up ventilators for patients who need them. You know, we now have these five vents. We probably — unless people die, I suspect we’ll be back to needing to beg for ventilators again in another day or two. There’s a mythical 100 vents out there which we haven’t seen. Leaders in various offices, from the president to the head of Health and Hospitals, saying things like, ‘We’re going to be fine. Everything’s fine.’ And from our perspective, everything is not fine. I don’t have the support that I need, and even just the materials that I need, physically, to take care of my patients. And it’s America, and we’re supposed to be a first-world country. On a regular day, my emergency department’s volume is pretty high. It’s about 200 people a day. Now we’re seeing 400 or more people a day. At first, we were trying to isolate patients with cough and fever and be more careful around them, but we weren’t necessarily being extra careful around all the other patients. And then we started to realize that patients who were coming in with no fever but abdominal pain actually had findings on their X-rays and chest CTs that were consistent with this coronavirus, Covid-19. So someone in a car accident gets brought in and we get a CT scan of them, and their lungs look like they have coronavirus. We were seeing a lot of patients who probably had Covid, but we didn’t realize. Ten residents and also many, many of our nurses and a few of the attending physicians got sick. The anxiety of this situation is really overwhelming. All of the doctors, it’s hard for us to get tested even if we want to, even if we have symptoms. We’re exposed over and over again. We don’t have the protective equipment that we should have. I put on one N95 mask in the morning. I need to have that N95 mask on for every patient I see. I don’t take it off all day. The N95 mask I wore today is also the N95 mask I wore on Friday. We’re always worried that we’ll be out of N95 masks. What’s a little bit scary now is the patients that we’re getting are much sicker. Many of the young people who are getting sick don’t smoke, they’re healthy, they have no co-morbidities. They’re just young, regular people between the ages of 30 and 50 who you would not expect to get this sick. So many people are saying it’s going to be OK, everything’s fine, we have what we need. And if this goes on for a month or two or three or five like it did in China, and we’re already this strained, we don’t have what we need. I don’t really care if I get in trouble for speaking to the media. I want people to know that this is bad. People are dying. We don’t have the tools that we need in the emergency department and in the hospital to take care of them, and — and it’s really hard.”",

Gavin Newsom of California said that by 1 p.m. Pacific time, about 700 of the 2,400 passengers had left the ship. “We want to see that processing stepped up,” he said, adding of the ship: “We don’t want to see it here more than a week.”\n\nAuthorities initially said it would take around two to three days to remove all passengers from the cruise ship, an operation that federal authorities are handling in an area of the port that has been cordoned off. The crew of 1,100 would stay on board. But Mr. Newsom said the authorities were now in negotiations with the home countries of crew members to send some of them there on charter flights.\n\nAlex Azar, the secretary of health and human services, said at a White House briefing that at least 171 Californians who have left the ship have been moved to Travis Air Force Base for a mandatory quarantine period. Mr. Azar said that 26 people were found to be sick and were being treated; he did not specify whether it was for the virus or other ailments.\n\nAt least 21 people aboard the two-week cruise to Hawaii have tested positive, and the figure is likely to rise.

More than 2,600 remained hospitalized.\n\nHospitals across New York City and surrounding areas reported increasing numbers of cases as administrators announced new restrictions on visitors, and workers warned about shortages in protective equipment.

    "article_text": "The rest of the country may regard New York as a black hole of need. But in fact the opposite has always been true; we’re forever sweeping more into the federal till than we receive in services. In 2018, according to the state comptroller’s office, we gave $26.6 billion more to Washington than we got back, ranking us dead last for federal benefits.\n\nNow, we finally have a native New Yorker in the White House to do something about this discrepancy. Instead, he’s the worst offender, and this time the consequences will be lethal.\n\nPart of me can’t help but wonder if Trump is just playing to his base, which views cities with suspicion, perhaps New York above all. We are multiculturalism personified — home of the United Nations, a place where 637 languages and dialects are spoken. A purée while the rest of the nation is vegetable soup, as Spalding Gray once lovingly said.\n\nNever mind that Trump is himself a creature of New York, just a different dimension of New York. Tabloid New York, real estate New York and (above all, and most ironically) global New York, which made possible his worldwide hotels, his construction projects made of Chinese steel, his loans from Deutsche Bank. It’s a New York he now disavows. A New York he now blames.\n\nBut it was New York that made him a reality television star. And what reality television prizes more than anything, we’ve learned, is a Darwinian frame of mind. The contestants aren’t there to make friends. They’re there to destroy each other. They’re there to win. Only the best win.\n\nBut this is not a game. Trump has no clue how to marshal the forces of federal government, which he stripped down to the studs. He has no unifying instincts at all. New York will be gasping for breath, and the other states will soon follow. Unless he takes action, now.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips.

It’s a textbook epidemic curve.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nItaly has quickly become the new epicenter of the pandemic, with nearly 30,000 infections and more than 2,000 deaths, numbers that are soaring by the day, even after the government there took extreme measures to lock down much of the country.\n\narchived recording (dr. jerome adams) We are at a critical inflection point in this country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. surgeon general warned that the United States is now on a strikingly similar path.\n\narchived recording (dr. jerome adams) People, we are where Italy was two weeks ago in terms of our numbers. And we have a choice to make as a nation. Do we want to go the direction of South Korea and really be aggressive and lower our mortality rates? Or do we want to go the direction of Italy?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nToday, a conversation with a doctor in Bergamo, north of Milan, one of Italy’s hardest hit areas.\n\n[music]\n\nIt’s Tuesday, March 17.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCould I just ask you to just say your full name for me?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nOK. My name is Fabiano Di Marco. I’m a professor of the University of Milan and the head of the respiratory unit of the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII of Bergamo, which is a town close to Milan.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCan you give me a sense, and maybe paint the picture, of what it’s like in the hospital right now, what you’re dealing with?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI have now — my ward has been totally transformed. Nothing is as before. I’ve been in my hospital every single day for 14 hours or 15 hours a day —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\n— to try to deal with the outbreak of coronavirus infection.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat has been the story of what has happened in your hospital these past few weeks? Because I think people in the United States are desperate to understand what you have seen, and what people have said to you, and what it has looked like. You described it as a war. So we want to understand what you mean.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nOK. Every day we receive, on average, between 50 to 70 patients with severe respiratory failure due to coronavirus infection. Every single day. And to describe my reality, my hospital is, at least in Europe, a huge hospital with 1,000 beds. But to receive every day between 50 and 70 patients with severe pneumonia due to coronavirus, it’s impossible. You have to change your organization day by day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd tell me what you mean. How do you have to change your organization to deal with people who are in such severe respiratory condition?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nSo we change it, the normal ward, mainly surgery wards, because the activity of surgery has been reduced off at least 80 percent. And we transform it, so far five wards of surgery for patients with coronavirus. Now we have, between the five wards and the emergency room, at least 350 patients with respiratory failure due to coronavirus infection.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nToday is the first day in which we have more than 50 percent of the hospital dedicated to coronavirus patients. To organize these, we had to teach cardiologists, dermatologists, rheumatologists — specialists of something very different from respiratory failure — how to treat this patient. You try to find a solution. But day by day, it’s no longer enough. So I can tell you that my colleagues, both physicians and nurses, they cry every day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI’m 47. I’m not so, so old to be the head of a ward, at least in Italy. But I have with me 20 colleagues who are respiratory physician, with many fellow. They are 27, 30. So for me, it’s a huge responsibility. And I was scared they can be sick. OK? But we cry every day. And now, we have today, 460 nurse at home because they are sick. And I think we have —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYes. It’s a very huge number.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou have 460 nurses who are in a hospital in the middle of this crisis who are home because they’re sick?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah, today. This is the outcome of today.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd is that because they are sick with the coronavirus?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThere are some who are sick, some with a total burnout for the situation, and other who are contact of patients, so they stay in quarantine at home.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDoctor, you said you are upset, that you maybe even cry every day. And I wonder if there is an experience, maybe one story or one patient, that made you upset?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThe main problem for us is to treat our colleagues. As doctor, we are used to treat patients. And for us it’s normal. There is not so emotional, luckily, because we are used to treat other people. But this is difficult when the patient is your colleague. And we have now admitted tens of colleagues or nurse, people who you will meet every day in your life.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYour colleagues are now your patients because they have contracted the virus.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. For example, yesterday, the chief of my department come to the emergency room to be with a low level of oxygenation. He has a bilateral pneumonia due to coronavirus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. I’m sorry.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nNot very severe. But he was someone who tried to organize the hospital to deal with this infection three days ago. And we went to have a dinner with my wife and his wife one week ago.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI don’t know. We are scared because on Friday, only in my hospital, we had 20 deaths.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n20 deaths.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. For coronavirus. In one day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat’s extraordinary.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. So another important thing, we have not had the opportunity to allow the relative to come to the hospital for two reasons. First, it’s a danger for them and for other people, evidently, because in 80 percent of the cases, they are infected. The second reason, which is not easy to understand if you are not in this situation, is that we do not have enough personal protective equipment — the mask in case of infection, something to cover the shoes, and the gown. It’s impossible to find these now Europe, not only in Italy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you’re running out of those and you can’t get them anywhere, in the region or anywhere in Europe. You just can’t get them.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. Impossible to find.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nIf I allow one or two relative to come to the hospital, I have to give them these. But we do not have this for us.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. You need them for doctors.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. They cannot receive the relative in hospital. So the patients are alone. And they die alone. We — this is difficult for us. We try to call, every day, the relative. But I have to tell you that sometimes, in the confusion of this new organization with a dermatologist who is trying to treat a patient with severe respiratory failure, and probably the doctors cry, and the — no one remember to call the relative. So it’s happened that the relative call the hospital —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd the person’s already dead.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back. Doctor, you’ve mentioned a lot of the choices that you and your staff have to make now that this is such a terrible situation. And I wonder how you make decisions about who gets which treatment, and who has the best chance to survive. How do you make those decisions?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThis is, for us, a crucial point, because we have hundreds of very sick patients. But we have tens of I.C.U. beds.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThe problem is that you can find many scores of gravity. But these scores of gravity have been thought for another reason. OK?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd when you say score of gravity, you mean, basically, kind of a calculation of who is in greatest need?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. So for instance, if you are 80, you have a severe respiratory failure, and I don’t know, you have also renal failure, I have to admit you in the I.C.U. because you are very severe. And you have a probability to die very high. OK. I have to admit you in the I.C.U.. But now we need another score, which is a score which help us to understand your probability to benefit of the I.C.U. bed. And we do not have this score. OK?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBecause it has not been created.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. We are trying to do this now, because for example, the age, for all of the stage of severity, higher is the age, higher is the score. But when you have few beds for many people, the age is absolutely the opposite. If you are 85, I give the bed to another one who is 45.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBecause 45-year-old is more likely to benefit from the I.C.U. bed than the 80-year-old. So you’re saying all the normal rules have to be thrown out the window.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. We need a new tool we do not have, because so far, the difference between the number of patients, number or bed, is something totally new for us. OK? And not only for us, all the country will have to deal with this. But it’s difficult to tell people that if you are 80, you will never have the I.C.U. bed.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOf course.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nBut so far, if you have not the opportunity to build a new hospital with 1,000 bed, such as in China, we need this terrible tool, because this is a tool of selection.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight — of who lives and who dies.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. And this is why it’s important. If you do not reduce the number of patients who are sick, it’s impossible to deal with this disease. Impossible. You have to reduce the rate of infection. And the only way to reduce the rate of infection is to change totally the life of people. Now, in Italy, everyone is at home. This is a tragedy for economy. No one is working. No one is working. But it’s the only way. There is not something in between.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like you’re saying that once you are in a hospital as a doctor, looking at a room full of people with this virus, overwhelmed, it’s too late. That the role of countries who are not yet at the place Italy is in is to make sure they don’t ever get to that place, don’t ever get to the point that your hospital is at. And to do whatever it takes to not get there.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. You have two choices. You decide to not close all the activities, close the people in their home, and you will accept thousand of beds. Or, you have to close all the activity. There is not a choice in between. I know this is difficult to have this approach, because also in Italy, if you speak with my colleague in another town, it’s quite difficult to understand this. Because many people, including many physicians, have not this perception of this. Because in your reality, all is normal. It’s difficult to be scared for something you have not the perception. OK? So I can understand that in other countries, it’s the same. But trust us, or, such as in Bergamo, each family will have a relative or a friend who dies. This is the situation in Bergamo. This is not a disease that you can discuss on TV, or you will have the perception of this in your family, in your relative, in your town. It’s something very aggressive, very aggressive.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder, as a doctor, what advice you would give to doctors in the United States who may have to do what you have to do and make the kind of difficult decisions that you have to make now.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI think that the best is to speak with us to analyze the situation of Italy. It could be something important. Because you have to be prepared for this. This is the only thing I would suggest to my colleague. Because also in Italy, I have some colleague in the other part of Italy who are not prepared. And I speak with them. They are doing the same thing we did three weeks ago. This is incredible. This new reality we are living started the 23rd of February, not three years ago. OK? Three weeks ago. After three weeks, we are living in another dimension. For me, it’s difficult to think to my life before this. No one can be prepared for this — impossible.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder, just a final question here. At the beginning of our conversation, you said you were finally home after three weeks. And I wonder what it was like to come home to your family. What are you telling them? And how are you feeling?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nMy children are at home now for three weeks. The schools are closed. Luckily there are three, so they can stay together. But we try to create a normal situation at home. For me, it’s difficult, because evidently, I have a risk of infection which is higher than compared to other people. So I had to decide what to do at home. If stay with a mask — sorry. And I decide to stay normal, without the mask.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like this was a tough decision.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah, because I have to find the solution between to protect the best, uh, my wife and do not scare my children. OK? The only good news is that children and young boys or girls are not affected. This is the only consolation for us. And I decide that I changed my approach to my children. OK? I pay attention to my hands. I pay attention to my towel. OK? But I decide to not wear a mask because it will be difficult for them to see the father who is a respiratory physician in Bergamo with those kind of cases, hundreds of that. So also for these, it’s really difficult to decide what is the best. And then I spoke with my wife. And we decided to do this.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like on top of all the difficult decisions you’ve had to make, you had to go home and make one more difficult decision, which was this mask.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. Absolutely.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDoctor, I really want to thank you so much for giving us your time. And I want to wish you the best of luck, you and all your colleagues, doctors and nurses at the hospital. We’re going to be thinking about you a lot in the coming days.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThank you. Thank you. It has been a privilege. I hope, indeed, to be useful for some of my colleagues and for you.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) This afternoon, we’re announcing new guidelines for every American to follow over the next 15 days. As we combat the virus, each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday, President Trump issued sweeping new health guidelines for Americans, encouraging them to work from home, avoid restaurants, bars, and food courts, and discretionary travel, and limit gatherings to 10 people or fewer.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation. And we will defeat the virus. And we’re going to have a big celebration all together.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut the guidelines are not mandatory. And the president stopped short of explicitly ordering Americans to stay home, as several countries in Europe and a handful of U.S. counties are now doing. On Monday, health officials in the Bay Area of California instructed nearly 7 million people to remain in their homes, with few exceptions, to slow the virus’s spread.\n\narchived recording These new orders direct all individuals to shelter at their place of residence and maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet from any other person when outside their residence. We know we need to do this. And we know we need a regional approach.\n\nmichael barbaro",

    "article_text": "The wisdom of each of those measures will be sorely tested now, as the coronavirus threatens to morph into a full-blown pandemic. More than 100,000 people across more than 80 countries have been infected with the new virus — and more than 3,400 of them have died, including at least 14 in the United States.\n\nProponents of closed borders and small social safety nets have a tendency to highlight the tension between citizen and noncitizen, to imply or explicitly state that the only way to help one group is to deprive the other. But the truth is, people on both sides are hanging by a thread.\n\nInfectious diseases, especially those like Covid-19, have a knack for penetrating and exposing such false dichotomies. Already, citizens who are underinsured or uninsured are being slammed with medical bills that they can’t afford when they seek testing and treatment for the virus. Unsurprisingly, experts say that many of them are bound to avoid such care as the outbreak rages on. If quarantines become routine, tens of millions of low-wage workers, many of whom don’t have health insurance or paid sick leave, will not be able to stock up and stay home. One shudders to think what will happen if the courts dismantle the Affordable Care Act in the next year — a move that could ultimately leave 21 million or so more people without health insurance.\n\nAmong noncitizens, the effects of the public charge rule and other fear-based immigration policies have long been apparent. New mothers are turning away free baby formula. Hungry families are turning away food assistance. The chronically and even fatally ill are avoiding hospitals and rejecting medical care. In 2019, The Atlantic reported that at least 200 eligible families in a Virginia county had stopped accepting WIC and that many were also turning down reduced-price lunches. Both of those programs are exempted from the public charge rule — using them will not count against a person’s visa or green card application — but those families were too afraid to chance it.\n\nIt’s easy to see how all this fear might feed on itself in the months ahead and also where that might lead. If citizens struggling to cover their own health care nurture resentments against any group perceived to be getting help to which they themselves are not entitled — or worse, if they grow xenophobic and subscribe to the notion that immigrants carry diseases — they might be compelled to endorse policies even more draconian than those already in play. That would create more anxiety among noncitizen communities, which would lead to fewer people seeking medical care when they need it. From there, the epidemic would only get worse.",

    "article_text": "Mr. President, very simple question. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your response to this crisis? [FLASHBACK SOUND EFFECT] The risk to the American people remains very low. This is an unprecedented potential severe health challenge. It’ll go away. Goes away. It’s going. away. We will see more cases and things will get worse than they are right now. In April, supposedly, it dies with the hotter weather. This virus is probably with us beyond this season, or beyond this year. This is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. Have you been briefed by the CDC? I have. Are there words about a pandemic at this point? No, not at all, and we have it totally under control. When you have 15 people and the 15, within a couple of days, is going to be down to close to zero. And we can expect to see more cases in the United States. We will see more cases. Unfortunately, we are likely to see more deaths. I like the numbers being where they are. I don’t need to have the numbers double. We’ll certainly have tens of thousands of cases in the US. Hopefully, we won’t hit hundreds of thousands of cases. We’d much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it, and that’s what we are. You are always behind where you think you are. If you think you’re here, you’re really here. Anybody that wants a test can get a test. Not everybody, tomorrow, is going to be able to get a test. Anybody that needs a test. That’s the important thing. And the tests are all perfect. The idea of anybody getting it easily, the way people in other country are doing it, we’re not set up for that. That is a failing. A failing? Yes. It is a failing, let’s admit it. Dr. Fauci said that the lag in testing was in fact a failing. Do you take responsibility for that? Yeah. No, I don’t take responsibility at all. They’re gonna have vaccines, I think, relatively soon. And they’re going to have— [CHEERING] something that makes you better. It would take them about a year to a year and a half to be fully confident that we would have a vaccine that would be able to protect the American people. I mean, I like the sound of a couple of months better, I must be honest. Is it safe or appropriate to be holding rallies during a public health crisis like this? I think it’s very safe. Yeah. You probably shouldn’t get on planes. You shouldn’t go into areas, large malls, large areas where people are congregating because it’s too high a risk. Getting away from shaking hands is a good thing. Maybe people shouldn’t be shaking hands for the long term because it does transmit flu and other things. I’m working on getting the boss to do this. I may not be successful, but we’re working on it. In terms of deaths, I don’t what the count is today. Is it 11? 11 people. What is the number as of this morning? Is it 32? You could tell me, is it 32 deaths, Steve? Unfortunately, one person passed away overnight. She was a wonderful woman, a medically high-risk patient in her late 50s. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your response to this crisis? I’d rate it a 10. I think we’ve done a great job.",

    "article_text": "In a city peppered with churches, the tornado was the kind of event that had many people wanting to gather with the rest of their congregations to find solace and community. Bishop Rodgers said that his congregation would continue to support its members in many ways and check on their well-being. But it would have to be at a distance.\n\n“We certainly want to be good citizens,” he said, adding that he knew of a funeral that had been attended by one person who was sick, which spread the virus to others. “All it takes is for one person to be sick, and many have been affected.”\n\nAs the tornado touched down, moving from south to north, some said they were at home watching the local television news, seeing in real time the funnel forming over the meteorologist’s shoulders. It caused significant damage at the Mall at Turtle Creek and at an Anheuser-Busch granary. Cars were picked up and tossed aside. Part of a freight train was knocked over.\n\n“All I could hear was just the most horrific exploding,” said Sharon Gore, 60, who could see the destroyed mall from her driveway. “There was so much glass cracking. I couldn’t believe it. I was just calling the name of Jesus over and over again, because I couldn’t even get a prayer out. It was like bombs were dropping.”\n\nJonesboro, a city of about 75,000 in northeast Arkansas, had been devastated by tornadoes before. A storm in 1968 killed 34 people and injured some 300 others. Another storm in 1973 also left a trail of destruction. Three people were killed, but it was hailed as a “miracle” for not being deadlier.",

    "article_text": "Mr. Schumer told his staff that the proposal was a nonstarter, and he directed them to quickly spread the word that Democrats would oppose the bill as it was, according to several people involved in the discussions who, like more than dozen lawmakers and senior officials interviewed for this story, spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the roller coaster negotiations that led to the passage of the largest stimulus measure in modern American history.\n\nThen he called his colleagues — including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a former presidential candidate who is influential on the left — to alert them to what he saw as a Republican ploy to muscle through a corporate giveaway. Within hours, Ms. Warren declared on Twitter that she would oppose the “giant slush fund” and urged other Democrats to join her. On a conference call later that day, Senator Patty Murray of Washington, not known for a temper, said she would be “a damn no” on the bill and urged her colleagues to do the same, which they did unanimously in a vote that sent futures markets plummeting.\n\nIt was a shocking and politically perilous decision in the middle of a paralyzing national crisis, a moment when lawmakers are traditionally expected to put aside differences for the good of the country, or face a political backlash.\n\nThe move was particularly infuriating for Republicans who had been willing to momentarily abandon their small-government zeal and agree to large additions to safety-net programs, including direct payments to Americans and a substantial increase in jobless aid, in the interest of sealing a quick deal with Democrats. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, would later call it a “stupid vote,” but Democrats said it proved crucial.\n\n“It showed McConnell that he was going to have to deal with us,” Mr. Schumer said.\n\nThe moment was a turning point for the rapid and fitful negotiations over the stimulus measure, which came together over a handful of frenzied days on Capitol Hill, as global markets convulsed with worry and lawmakers scrambled to agree before Covid-19 could infect their ranks and cripple Congress.",

    "article_text": "Things are moving far too quickly, and not just from an epidemiological perspective. Yesterday was approximately six and a half years ago. For writers, as the tentacles of the coronavirus unfurl each day, everything is copy. But what happens when every writer on the planet starts taking notes on the same subject? Will we all hand in our book reports simultaneously, a year from now? The nature of tragedy is that it takes more than it gives, but it’s also produced some of our most iconic literature. The Great Depression brought “The Grapes of Wrath.” The Spanish Inquisition helped inspire “Don Quixote.” Cholera gave Camus “The Plague” (so to speak). Shakespeare, Twitter has been quick to remind us, wrote under quarantine. There’s something comfortingly glib about art-shaming in the midst of being told you’re a vector for death. The Accidental Murderer: And Other Stories.\n\nFrom an artistic standpoint, it’s best to let tragedy cool before gulping it down and spitting it back into everyone’s faces. After all, “Don Quixote” was published about a century into the Spanish Inquisition. Art should be given a metaphorical berth as wide as the literal one we’re giving one another. Right now we are distracted and anxious beyond measure, but things will settle (how much and when remains to be seen), and then? I think of the opening scene of Noah Baumbach’s first film, “Kicking and Screaming,” in which two young writers start taking notes on a fight as they’re having it.\n\n“What if I want this material?” asks the boy.\n\n“We’ll see who gets it first,” says the girl.\n\nWe all know how limited this kind of get-it-while-it’s-hot writing will seem in the future. That’s never stopped us from doing it. It’s not stopping me from indulging in a version of it right now. Look at the narratives that came out in the years immediately following 9/11. They have not aged well. Really, we’re only just now nailing World War I. But like everyone else, writers feel the need to distill life as a means of surviving it.\n\nOur particular era strikes me as especially susceptible to this impulse. Part of the reason is that our response to disaster (terrorist attacks, hurricanes, school shootings) is to get out there and declare the death of irony. Like Steve Carell’s character on “The Office,” who declares bankruptcy by screaming, “I declare bankruptcy!,” you can’t just cry sincerity because you want a shortcut to perspective or because you want to keep your jokes inoffensive. When the coronavirus has passed, we will say, sincerely, perhaps for the first time in our lives, Our long national nightmare is over. But this will not be our final use of the phrase. It will be a caption on the Instagram post of someone’s post-quarantine haircut, I promise. Yet in the moment, we feel the need to prove our solemnity on social media by setting a universal mood, and this is poison to actual book writing.",

But when it comes to the nation’s response to the new coronavirus, I cannot be so reassuring.\n\nA crucial thing to understand about the coronavirus threat — and it’s playing out grimly in Italy — is the difference between the total number of people who might get sick and the number who might get sick at the same time.

Bush administration, homeland security and health officials focused on big gaps in the American response to a biological attacks and the growing risk of pandemics. The first test came in April 2009, just a few months after the start of President Barack Obama’s first term. A 10-year-old California girl was diagnosed with a contagious disease that would be called swine flu or H1N1, the first flu pandemic in more than 40 years.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that ultimately there were about 60.8 million cases in the United States, along with 274,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths associated with H1N1.\n\nThe virus turned out to be less deadly than first expected. But it was a warning shot that officials in the Obama administration said they took seriously, kicking off a planning effort that escalated in early 2014, with the outbreak of Ebola in West Africa and ensuing fear that it could spread to the United States.\n\nEbola was less contagious than the flu, but far more deadly. It killed 11,000 people in Africa. But it could have been far worse. The United States sent nearly 3,000 troops to Africa to help keep the disease from spreading. While the containment effort was considered a success, inside the White House, officials sensed that the United States had gotten lucky — and that the response had revealed gaps in preparedness.\n\nChristopher Kirchhoff, a national security aide who moved from the Pentagon to the White House to deal with the Ebola crisis, was given the job of putting together a “lessons learned” report, with input from across the government.",

    "article_text": "The Chinese government has one of the most extensive propaganda networks in the world inside the country, but it also aggressively works to influence how it’s perceived outside its borders. “Good morning, President Xi!” China has invested billions into bolstering its image abroad. Its state-run news outlets push out messages in English around the clock — “You’re watching CGTN.” “Live in Beijing.” “From Nairobi.” “Washington, D.C.” — and its diplomats have flocked to Twitter in the last year. But what happens when this massive P.R. apparatus has to do major damage control? We analyzed thousands of tweets from Chinese state media and official accounts and found three dominant messages China wants to project to the world. Here’s what we learned. A novel coronavirus hit the Chinese city of Wuhan in January. Early whistleblowers were silenced. People were angry about a government cover-up. But in the majority of tweets we analyzed, state-owned publications pushed a much more optimistic view, promoting what they said was an effective response. They are sharing videos like this. The Chinese Communist Party refers to this as positive energy, only focusing on the bright side of an issue. China did take drastic measures to try and stem the outbreak, but that’s the only story China wants the world to see. And state media is eager to run praise from foreign experts to back up China’s successes. One tweet from state media that did reveal Chinese citizens’ discontent — — it was quickly deleted. Once the virus spread across the world, China started positioning itself as being at the forefront of fighting the pandemic. It presented itself as a partner, a grateful recipient, and more recently a selfless leader, highlighting large donations from Chinese companies and the government. China hasn’t typically disparaged other countries’ responses to the virus, with one exception — the United States. “President Donald Trump has been accused of denying, downplaying and outright rejecting the concerns over the Covid-19 outbreak.” Another thing we noticed are Chinese outlets disputing the origin of the virus. It all started in late February with a renowned Chinese epidemiologist. Around the same time, the C.D.C. reported the first case in the United States with an unknown origin. A screenshot of the announcement incorrectly translated in Chinese began to trend online and was untouched by Chinese government censors. And a high-ranking government spokesperson actively pushed disinformation about where the virus came from. A government giving an optimistic spin to bad news is not unique. “We want to go big, go solid. The country is very strong. We’ve never been so strong.” But the scale of the Chinese propaganda machine is, and it’s clear that it’s being deployed to try and tell the world a new story about the coronavirus pandemic.",

It felt like a stab to my chest. I’m Chinese-American, and this is someone that I’ve gone to school with for almost three years, who I consider a friend. But it’s no wonder that she feels this way. “An obscure virus arising from a meat market in eastern China.” As the Coronavirus spreads, there’s another virus spreading that we need to be talking about. “A woman who’s Asian says she was punched by another woman in midtown Manhattan and she accused her of having the Covid-19 virus.” “I don’t want him [inaudible] me. Tell him to move.” Young Asian-Americans like me are feeling hate infect every part of our lives. “And I’d like to just ask the Chinese for a formal apology.” Not only do we have to be afraid about our health. But we have to be afraid about being ourselves. Class basically just started. One of the girls said all Chinese people were disgusting. And so I literally like raised my hand up and was like “I’m Chinese.” She didn’t even say sorry. She didn’t. She just like blew past it I guess. And then she like kept going on about it. I never knew it would happen to me, especially at this school. Good morning. Morning. Yeah, basically this Chinese restaurant was like texting their customers saying none of our staff have been to China. We have no contact with the Coronavirus. Please like like, come back to us. And people were like making fun of it. There are thousands and thousands of cases in Italy. But no one’s boycotting Olive Garden. No seriously like, no one is boycotting a mom and pop’s pizza place. Like it’s the same thing. Historically, pandemics have stoked xenophobia. In the 19th century, people spread rumors that Irish immigrants carried cholera, and tuberculosis was known as the “Jewish disease.” In 1900, when a Chinese man supposedly died of the plague in San Francisco, Chinatown residents were forcibly quarantined by police, while white residents were allowed to leave the area. It seems like since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak schools have been a Petri dish for racism. It’s dangerous to normalize behavior like this for people my age. So you just spoke with the other student. So can you tell me what happened? She understood my frustration and anger. They didn’t really mean to say that. And they were actually making a generalization. And so she apologized to me basically. And I really appreciated it. Coronavirus may have originated in China. But the disease doesn’t discriminate in the way that people do. It’s extremely important that people have accurate information on how to stay safe. So we can kill this virus without spreading another one.",

    "article_text": "And they harm all of us. Some countries responded slowly to the coronavirus threat because they deemed it a condition primarily lethal to old people “less worthy of the best efforts to contain it,” the World Health Organization’s director general, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, noted recently. That some of the national leaders abiding by this assessment are themselves in the highest risk group is testament to one of the fundamental truths of ageism: that it is pervasive among old people themselves in ways that threaten both personal and national health.\n\nThe news and social media have been full of similarly counterproductive messages, even cruel memes such as “Boomer Remover,” a descendant of last year’s dismissive and condescending “OK, Boomer.”\n\nThis matters in the era of Covid-19 because in a culture that persists in ignoring the last century’s huge gains in longevity and the obvious differences between young and much older adults, we are unable to address the needs of older Americans. It matters because the isolation necessary for slowing the rate of contagion will also cause irreparable harm to their health and have both short- and long-term economic effects. And it matters because when we accept the second-class citizenship of an entire category of human being, we set a precedent for treating others with the same disregard.\n\nThe effects of this isolation are being seen throughout the country. On Twitter, a young woman in Oregon described being called over to a car at her supermarket where a couple in their 80s sat scared to go inside lest they become infected; they handed her $100 to do their shopping so that they wouldn’t starve. One of my geriatrics colleagues who cares for people in assisted living facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area told me one patient had commented that his current living situation was “like being in solitary confinement and we have no idea for how long.” A photo picked up by many news outlets shows a Connecticut man holding a sign outside his wife’s nursing home window that said: “I’ve loved you 67 years and still do. Happy anniversary.”\n\nIsolation and neglect add to a history of systematic injury. The Trump administration didn’t just eliminate the federal office of pandemic preparedness and dismiss or drive away scientists and experts at all levels of government; it also moved to decrease nursing home oversight and infection-control regulations. Meanwhile, although I could cite abundant data on the poor quality of many nursing homes and on the ubiquity of loneliness, neglect and mistreatment, and I could note that the facility in Kirkland, Wash., that responded so slowly to a lethal contagion had a top government rating, it is more compelling to simply ask: If you don’t already live in a nursing home, are you looking forward to the time when you can move into one?",

    "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/opinion/coronavirus-disabled-health-care.html",
    "article_text": "Today my father has Parkinson’s disease and dementia, and lives in a skilled nursing facility. Even before Covid-19, it was a struggle for people to act as if his life was still worth protecting. They speak about him in the past tense, using language like “no quality of life.” The term “useless eater” hangs just beyond what’s said aloud. I am terrified of how Covid-19 will hit him, and everyone I care for with dementia in my hospice program.\n\nAs a disabled, Jewish, second-generation Holocaust survivor, the words “useless eater” are practically in my DNA. I can taste the tang of them in my mouth as I read the news, in the bitterness of Italy’s policies, in this country’s callous health care, in affluent people refusing to listen to sick and disabled voices and stay home when they can afford to, in the dismissive internet comments that only the sick and old need to worry, so who cares?\n\nMy cells remember other things, too. That to survive illness and trauma, whether individual or communal, we need one another, including strangers. When my father was two years old, hiding from Nazis in a Christian foster home, he developed a loud case of whooping cough. He was dropped unceremoniously at the doors of a Belgian nunnery. These women nursed him back to health, and returned him a few months later, fully recovered. I wish I knew their names. These faceless women to whom I owe my existence, who cared for him, bathed him, changed him, powdered him.\n\nIn this moment, one of the best ways you can show up and save the lives of fellow human beings is by withdrawing physically. Staying away from other people contradicts our image of what saving lives looks like. We are used to heroes rushing in. But disabled and sick people already know that stillness can be caring. We know that immune systems are fragile things, and homes can’t always be left. Rest is disability justice, and right now it is one of our most powerful tools to keep one another alive.\n\nI have spent years of my life rarely leaving home. Being stuck at home due to illness often sucks, but sometimes it is other things, too. Calm. The kinds of connection that can only come from profound slowness, from borrowing down instead of stretching out. Even as we withdraw physically, our emotional and spiritual need for others has never been more visible. I already knew that we needed one another in intimate ways that go beyond the capacity of our bodies to connect. Disabled people are experts in deep, luscious intimacy without touch. We are used to being creative. As the Disability Justice performance project Sins Invalid says, “We love like barnacles,” sticking to one another wherever, and however we can.\n\nJewish mysticism holds that the letters of a Torah scroll are black fire on the white fire of the parchment. In this moment, we must find a way to make the spaces between us holy. In this pandemic it is the white fire that will hold our abundant love, our exquisite care, and our unwavering belief that each of our lives is worth saving.\n\nA collection of 60 essays from this series is now available in book, e-book and audiobook form: “About Us: Essays From the Disability Series of The New York Times,” edited by Peter Catapano and Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, published by Liveright.\n\nElliot Kukla is a rabbi at the Bay Area Jewish Healing Center in San Francisco. He is at work on a book about being chronically ill in a time of planetary crisis.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

    "article_text": "But those benefits only apply to employees of businesses with fewer than 500 employees, or the government, who are infected by the virus, quarantined, have a sick family member or are affected by school closings. Large employers are excluded, and the Labor Department will have the option of exempting workers at any company with fewer than 50 employees, if it determines that providing paid leave “would jeopardize the viability of the business as a going concern.”\n\nThose exemptions could potentially exclude nearly 20 million workers. About 59 million Americans work for companies with 500 or more employees, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and about 6.5 million of them do not have any paid sick days. Another 12 million work for companies with fewer than 50 employees and do not have paid sick days. (Some large companies have announced since the outbreak began that they will provide paid leave for workers who get the virus. Walmart said it would give up to two weeks of pay; Target said it would give 14 days.)\n\nThe bill also limits benefits to workers who are sick, subject to a quarantine or caring for a family member; it stops short of what some public health experts have called for — effectively paying any worker to stay home, in order to reduce the spread of the virus.\n\nIt also excludes “certain health care providers and emergency responders” from the benefit.\n\nCompanies covered by the policy will not foot the bill for paid leave. The government is providing new tax credits to both help offset the costs of accommodating the new mandate and the economic impact of the outbreak.\n\nThe paid leave provisions were among the most contentious elements of the legislation. Republicans objected to a proposal by Democrats to establish a permanent paid sick leave entitlement for all families, according to a Democratic aide familiar with the negotiations, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the private negotiations.",

    "article_text": "‘We Take the Dead From Morning Till Night’\n\nThe streets of Bergamo are empty. As in all of Italy, people can leave their homes only for food and medicines and work. The factories and shops and schools are closed. There is no more chatting on the corners or in the coffee bars.\n\nBut what won’t stop are the sirens.\n\nWhile the world’s attention now shifts to its own centers of contagion, the sirens keep sounding. Like the air raid sirens of the Second World War, they are the ambulance sirens that many survivors of this war will remember. They blare louder as they get closer, coming to collect the parents and grandparents, the keepers of Italy’s memory.\n\nThe grandchildren wave from terraces, and spouses sit back on the corners of now empty beds. And then the sirens start again, becoming fainter as the ambulances drive away toward hospitals crammed with coronavirus patients.\n\n“At this point, all you hear in Bergamo is sirens,” said Michela Travelli.\n\nOn March 7, her father, Claudio Travelli, 60, was driving a food delivery truck all around northern Italy. The next day, he developed a fever and flu-like symptoms. His wife had run a fever in recent days, and so he called his family doctor, who told him to take a common Italian fever reducer and rest up.\n\nFor much of the prior month, Italian officials had sent mixed messages about the virus.\n\nOn Feb. 19, some 40,000 people from Bergamo, a province of about a million people in the region of Lombardy, traveled 30 miles to Milan to watch a Champions League soccer game between Atalanta and the Spanish team Valencia. (The mayor of Bergamo, Giorgio Gori, this week called the match “a strong accelerator of contagion.”) Mr. Travelli and his wife didn’t take the threat of the virus seriously back then, their daughter said, “because it wasn’t sold as a grave thing.”\n\nBut Mr. Travelli could not shake his fever, and he got sicker.\n\nOn Friday, March 13, he felt unbearable pressure on his chest and suffered dry heaves. His temperature spiked and his family called an ambulance. An ambulance crew found her father with low levels of oxygen in his blood but, following the advice of Bergamo’s hospitals, recommended he stay home. “They said, ‘We have seen worse, and the hospitals are like the trenches of a war,’” Ms. Travelli said.",

    "article_text": "The new census data offers details about the populations of counties and metropolitan areas. Dr. Johnson calculated that deaths now exceed births in about 46 percent of counties in the country, far more than at the start of the decade, when the pattern held in just 29 percent of counties. Now large swaths of New England, Western Pennsylvania, Central Florida and much of Appalachia glow red on his map of counties that exhibit the pattern.\n\nOnce the pattern starts, it can be hard to stop. Dr. Johnson estimated that 90 percent of the counties that experienced the imbalance in one year saw it repeated during the decade. These tend to be places with little immigration and a dwindling number of young families. Their schools tend to close because there are not enough children to fill them.\n\nAll of this has had a dramatic effect on the populations in cities and towns. Large metro areas had the steepest decline over the course of the decade, Mr. Frey found in an analysis, with the growth rate down by nearly half. Rural areas, in contrast, grew slightly by the end of the decade, though that followed several years of declines.\n\nPlaces that had once been popular destinations for young people — New York, Los Angeles and Chicago — ended the decade with some of the biggest declines. New York began losing population in 2017, and last year it registered a loss of more than 60,000 people, the biggest population decline of any American city, Mr. Frey found.\n\nThe housing market collapse of 2008 and the rising prices in suburbs prompted millennials to move to big coastal cities. But that pattern reversed by mid-decade, Mr. Frey said, as millennials fled rising rents and home prices.\n\nPlaces with the biggest gains for the decade were Dallas, Houston, Phoenix, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. Medium-size metro areas, like Las Vegas, have also moved up the ranks of gainers, as have Charlotte, N.C.; Seattle; and Austin, Texas.",

    "article_text": "Facing an accelerating spread of Covid-19, Italy and Japan have closed schools to impede the epidemic. Some communities in the United States have done so too, agreeing to significantly disrupt people’s lives on the theory that it will prevent deaths and serious illness.\n\nBut there is no clear evidence that such measures will slow this outbreak.\n\nMost of what we know about the impact of school closings on disease transmission relates to influenza, to which children can be particularly vulnerable, sometimes dying or becoming seriously ill from it.\n\nChildren are important drivers of influenza infections because they have more interactions with people than do most adults and also give off more of the virus. Closing schools, it is assumed, reduces the number of contacts and thus the rate of transmission.\n\nDuring the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, schools across the country were closed. A C.D.C. study showed that parents largely supported these measures, but other studies found that children frequently got together outside the home or visited public sites, despite official recommendations not to do so. Fortunately, schools reopened in less than three days in most cases because data showed the flu strain wasn’t as severe as had been feared.",

    "article_text": "Milan, New York, New Delhi, Madrid — just a few of the many global cities that are shut down to prevent the coronavirus pandemic. And then, there’s Mexico City. Here, off the bustling Paseo de la Reforma, there’s an unsettling sense of normalcy. Flight attendants, newly arrived from the United States, walk around carefree. “I think on the one hand, it’s refreshing for us because we’re coming from a place that’s taking extreme precautions. We are on a petri dish most of the time, so I might already be exposed — more likely on the plane than probably here.” Mexico has documented four deaths from Covid-19. One man died after attending a large music concert. Doctors say the virus is already spreading in the community. “We don’t have tests, so we are having low numbers of patients that are infected.” Dr. Francisco Moreno oversees nine Covid patients at Mexico City’s ABC Hospital. He’s self-isolating, so I interviewed him remotely. “Do you think Mexico could be as bad as Italy?” But Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has continued to say there is no cause for alarm, and resists the measures other countries have taken to slow the virus’s spread. This was his message in early March. López Obrador, also known as AMLO, has continued to hold political rallies around Mexico, shaking hands and hugging admirers. Other government officials may encourage social distancing, but he asks people to go out and spend their pesos. But according to a recent O.E.C.D. report, Mexico has fewer nurses and fewer intensive care beds per capita than Italy, South Korea and the U.S. A count of ventilators in state facilities revealed only about 2,050 machines in the entire country. International leaders have criticized López Obrador’s response to the crisis as irresponsible. The president of El Salvador even begged Mexico, via Twitter, to take more drastic measures so as not to become the next epicenter of the pandemic.",

But it’s no wonder that she feels this way. “An obscure virus arising from a meat market in eastern China.” As the Coronavirus spreads, there’s another virus spreading that we need to be talking about. “A woman who’s Asian says she was punched by another woman in midtown Manhattan and she accused her of having the Covid-19 virus.” “I don’t want him [inaudible] me. Tell him to move.” Young Asian-Americans like me are feeling hate infect every part of our lives. “And I’d like to just ask the Chinese for a formal apology.” Not only do we have to be afraid about our health. But we have to be afraid about being ourselves. Class basically just started. One of the girls said all Chinese people were disgusting. And so I literally like raised my hand up and was like “I’m Chinese.” She didn’t even say sorry. She didn’t. She just like blew past it I guess. And then she like kept going on about it. I never knew it would happen to me, especially at this school. Good morning. Morning. Yeah, basically this Chinese restaurant was like texting their customers saying none of our staff have been to China. We have no contact with the Coronavirus. Please like like, come back to us. And people were like making fun of it. There are thousands and thousands of cases in Italy. But no one’s boycotting Olive Garden. No seriously like, no one is boycotting a mom and pop’s pizza place. Like it’s the same thing. Historically, pandemics have stoked xenophobia. In the 19th century, people spread rumors that Irish immigrants carried cholera, and tuberculosis was known as the “Jewish disease.” In 1900, when a Chinese man supposedly died of the plague in San Francisco, Chinatown residents were forcibly quarantined by police, while white residents were allowed to leave the area. It seems like since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak schools have been a Petri dish for racism. It’s dangerous to normalize behavior like this for people my age. So you just spoke with the other student. So can you tell me what happened? She understood my frustration and anger. They didn’t really mean to say that. And they were actually making a generalization. And so she apologized to me basically. And I really appreciated it. Coronavirus may have originated in China. But the disease doesn’t discriminate in the way that people do. It’s extremely important that people have accurate information on how to stay safe. So we can kill this virus without spreading another one.",

Mr. Azar did not include Dr. Hahn on the virus task force he led, though some of the F.D.A. commissioner’s aides participated in H.H.S. meetings on the subject.\n\nAnd tensions grew between the secretary and Dr. Redfield as the testing issue persisted. Mr. Azar and Dr. Redfield have been on the phone as often as a half-dozen times a day. But throughout February, as the C.D.C. test faltered, Mr. Azar became convinced that Dr. Redfield’s agency was providing him with inaccurate information about testing that the secretary repeated publicly, according to several administration officials.\n\nIn one instance, Mr. Azar appeared on Sunday morning news programs and said that more than 3,600 people had been tested for the virus. In fact, the real number was much smaller because many patients were tested multiple times, an error the C.D.C. had to correct in congressional testimony that week. One health department official said Mr. Azar was repeatedly assured that the C.D.C.’s test would be widely available within a week or 10 days, only to be given the same promise a week later.\n\nAsked about criticism of his agency’s response to the pandemic, Dr. Redfield said: “I’m personally not focused on whether they’re pointing fingers here or there. We’re focused on doing all we can to get through this outbreak as quickly as possible and keep America safe.”\n\nFor all Mr. Azar’s complaints, however, he continued to defer to the scientists at the two agencies, according to several administration officials. Mr. Azar’s allies said he was told by Dr. Redfield and Dr. Fauci that the C.D.C. had the resources it needed, that there was no reason to believe the virus was spreading through the country from person to person and that it was important to test only people who met certain criteria.",

    "article_text": "In “Wondering About Social Distancing?” Apoorva Mandavilli explains the term and offers practical guidance from experts:\n\nWhat is social distancing? Put simply, the idea is to maintain a distance between you and other people — in this case, at least six feet. That also means minimizing contact with people. Avoid public transportation whenever possible, limit nonessential travel, work from home and skip social gatherings — and definitely do not go to crowded bars and sporting arenas. “Every single reduction in the number of contacts you have per day with relatives, with friends, co-workers, in school will have a significant impact on the ability of the virus to spread in the population,” said Dr. Gerardo Chowell, chair of population health sciences at Georgia State University. This strategy saved thousands of lives both during the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 and, more recently, in Mexico City during the 2009 flu pandemic.\n\nThe article continues with expert responses to some common questions about social distancing. Here are excerpts from three:\n\nI’m young and don’t have any risk factors. Can I continue to socialize? Please don’t. There is no question that older people and those with underlying health conditions are most vulnerable to the virus, but young people are by no means immune. And there is a greater public health imperative. Even people who show only mild symptoms may pass the virus to many, many others — particularly in the early course of the infection, before they even realize they are sick. So you might keep the chain of infection going right to your own older or high-risk relatives. You may also contribute to the number of people infected, causing the pandemic to grow rapidly and overwhelm the health care system. If you ignore the guidance on social distancing, you will essentially put yourself and everyone else at much higher risk. Experts acknowledged that social distancing is tough, especially for young people who are used to gathering in groups. But even cutting down the number of gatherings, and the number of people in any group, will help. Can I leave my house? Absolutely. The experts were unanimous in their answer to this question. It’s O.K. to go outdoors for fresh air and exercise — to walk your dog, go for a hike or ride your bicycle, for example. The point is not to remain indoors, but to avoid being in close contact with people. You may also need to leave the house for medicines or other essential resources. But there are things you can do to keep yourself and others safe during and after these excursions. When you do leave your home, wipe down any surfaces you come into contact with, disinfect your hands with an alcohol-based sanitizer and avoid touching your face. Above all, frequently wash your hands — especially whenever you come in from outside, before you eat or before you’re in contact with the very old or very young. How long will we need to practice social distancing? That is a big unknown, experts said. A lot will depend on how well the social distancing measures in place work and how much we can slow the pandemic down. But prepare to hunker down for at least a month, and possibly much longer. In Seattle, the recommendations on social distancing have continued to escalate with the number of infections and deaths, and as the health system has become increasingly strained. “For now, it’s probably indefinite,” Dr. Marrazzo said. “We’re in uncharted territory.”\n\nAbdullah Shihipar writes in an Opinion essay, “Coronavirus and the Isolation Paradox,” that while social distancing is required to prevent infection, loneliness can make us sick:\n\nA paradox of this moment is that while social distancing is required to contain the spread of the coronavirus, it may also contribute to poor health in the long run. So while physical isolation will be required for many Americans who have Covid-19 or have been exposed to it, it’s important that we don’t let such measures cause social and emotional isolation, too. The Health Resources and Services Administration cautions that loneliness can be as damaging to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Feelings of isolation and loneliness can increase the likelihood of depression, high blood pressure, and death from heart disease. They can also affect the immune system’s ability to fight infection — a fact that’s especially relevant during a pandemic. Studies have shown that loneliness can activate our fight-or-flight function, causing chronic inflammation and reducing the body’s ability to defend itself from viruses.\n\nThe essay continues:\n\nFor solutions, we can look to countries where people have been dealing with coronavirus for some time. As the BBC reported, people in China are turning to creative means to stay connected. Some are streaming concerts and gym classes. Others are organizing virtual book-club meetings. In Wuhan, people gathered at their windows to shout “Wuhan, jiayou!” which translates to “Keep fighting, Wuhan!” A business owner packed 200 meals for medical workers, while a villager in a neighboring province donated 15,000 masks to those in need. For those of us who know people, especially elderly people, who may be isolated, get connected. Check in daily and look for ways to spend time together, either through a FaceTime or WhatsApp call, through collaborative gaming or just by using the telephone.\n\nIt concludes:\n\nIt may provide some comfort to know that thousands of other people are going through the same thing, and as in China, collective coping strategies will emerge. TikTok videos, memes, stories, essays and poems about living in isolation will all become part of the culture. We could come out of this feeling more connected to each other than before.\n\nStudents, read ONE of the articles in its entirety, then tell us:\n\nHow is the coronavirus affecting your life — physically, socially and emotionally?

    "article_text": "michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: States and cities across the U.S. are reporting dangerous shortages of vital supplies needed to contain the pandemic. Sarah Kliff on what’s behind those shortages. It’s Tuesday, March 31.\n\narchived recording (bill de blasio) Well, it’s Friday, what feels like has been an endless week. I know so many New Yorkers have really felt this week. It’s been very, very difficult.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nLast Friday in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio gave a news conference, and he essentially came out and said that the city is running out of medical supplies.\n\narchived recording (bill de blasio) We’re getting through this week. It’s tough. We have what we need for next week, but it will definitely be a very hard week. But after next Sunday, April 5 is when I get very, very worried about everything we’re going to need. The people power we’re going to need, the equipment, the supplies, obviously the ventilators.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nThat they only have about a week left of the things they really need.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\narchived recording (bill de blasio) But I want to put down that marker right now, and I’ve put down that marker to the White House, that that is a decisive moment for the city of New York. We need to make sure that we can get to that day ready to face the week after that and the week after that as well. And right now, we’re not there.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nAnd this is what we’re hearing from mayors, from governors all across the country.\n\narchived recording (john bel edwards) Everybody’s looking for ventilators. Everybody’s looking for P.P.E. Everybody’s looking for medical staff, and everybody’s looking for beds. And so that’s what makes this particularly hard.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nThere aren’t enough supplies to treat the coronavirus outbreak.\n\narchived recording (gretchen whitmer) There’s not enough ventilators. We need thousands of ventilators in Michigan. There is not enough N95 masks. We’ve got nurses who are wearing the same mask from the minute they show up for their long shift to the end of that shift.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nThere aren’t enough masks. There aren’t enough hospital beds. There aren’t enough ventilators. The list is long, and hospitals are getting worried about running out.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo how can that be? How is it that the U.S. is running so low, and in many cases, actually running out of so many essential components of a response to this pandemic?\n\nsarah kliff\n\nWell, for each component, there’s actually a unique backstory. There’s a clear reason why we don’t have enough and why it is hard to get more.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, let’s go through each one of the three that you mentioned, starting with what would seem to me like the easiest problem to solve, which is masks. So what explains the shortage there?\n\nsarah kliff\n\nThe masks were one of the first things to come into shortage. It was one of the first places where we started realizing we might not have enough supplies for our health care workers.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nAnd to understand the shortage of masks, you probably want to go back 20 or 30 years.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nBack then, a lot of the masks that were being used in hospitals were made in the United States. That really shifted about 15 years ago or so. You saw mask manufacturers, like other manufacturers, moving their operations offshore, where they could manufacture masks cheaper. A lot of them went to China. And if you think about it, you can manufacture abroad. You didn’t need a ton of specialized equipment, and then you could ship it right back to the United States. Orders are generally pretty predictable. At the time, it seemed like a prudent business decision for mask manufacturers to move their business to places where labor was cheaper.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so why is there now a shortage if this was a rational outsourcing decision with predictable deliveries from China to the U.S., that would allow us to create a stockpile?\n\nsarah kliff\n\nThis system made sense when you understood the health care needs — when you knew a certain number of people tended to get the flu, so here is how many surgical masks you would need in a country. It really falls apart when you have a pandemic like coronavirus, which has spiked the amount of health care supplies we need. And all of a sudden, we’re in the situation where the surgical masks we want are half a world away. A lot of the transport that we rely on has been shut down. And other countries where the masks are being made are saying, we need these masks, too. This is particularly true in China, which had a coronavirus outbreak before us, and in certain cases has been holding on to its masks, not allowing manufacturers to export them abroad.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nSo it made sense at the time, but it was not a supply chain built for the pandemic we’re in right now.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo how solvable is this problem, given what you’ve laid out?\n\nsarah kliff\n\nIt is solvable, but it takes time and it takes some kind of unusual measures. So one of the things you do see happening is factories being turned over to mask manufacturing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nAnd companies are trying to do that. If you look at Honeywell, for example, they’ve a factory that makes glasses and goggles usually. They’re going to turn that over to making masks, but they say it’s going to take about a month to make the transition. They’re going to have to hire 500 workers. You can’t just flip a switch in these factories that have been used from something else. And I think that’s why you see everyone trying anything possible. It’s why individuals are sewing masks at home and giving them to their local hospitals. That’s how dire the need is, that we’re really looking at any possible way to make a mask, even if it’s not in the traditional factories that typically manufacture them.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK, so that is masks. Where should we turn next?\n\nsarah kliff\n\nI think we should talk about hospital beds.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nWe’re facing a pretty dire shortage there, but for entirely different reasons. So the United States has significantly fewer hospital beds per capita than a lot of our peer countries and a lot of other countries that are fighting coronavirus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nAnd you can really trace that back to a law that passed in 1974. This was about a decade after Medicare and Medicaid had come into existence, and all of a sudden, the government had become a huge payer of health care bills.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nSo they had a significant reason to be concerned about rising health care costs. And one of the things they started noticing was that when you had more hospital beds, they just seemed to get filled.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nIt’s like when you add a lane onto a highway, you think it’s going to make the traffic better. It just turns out more cars show up and start using that route. The theory there being that however many beds you have, hospitals, which are businesses, they will find a way to fill them. So policymakers identified that having all these hospital beds was probably driving up costs, because hospitals had strong financial incentives to keep those hospital beds full. So in 1974, they passed this law that essentially required hospitals to apply for permission to build beds. So if I wanted to build a 500-bed hospital in New York, I’d have to go to the state and say, here’s why I think there aren’t enough hospitals in this area and why I should be allowed to build this new hospital.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what is the impact of that law on the number of beds in our system?\n\nsarah kliff\n\nIt really limited the number of beds. We’ve shed about a half million hospital bed since 1974. I think that’s pretty telling.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nThere’s other things driving this. Certain procedures that used to require a few nights in a hospital have gotten faster and safer, so you don’t really need that. Medicines have gotten better, so certain things that used to be treated with surgery, you can treat with prescriptions. But at the core of this, we really have made this decision that we want to limit the number of hospital beds in the United States. And that might help hold down costs in a normal time, but then we get to a pandemic and all of a sudden it becomes a real constraint on our ability to treat a wave of sick patients.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. So we created this shortage on purpose, and with a reasonable motive that just wasn’t anticipating what it would mean in a crisis.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nExactly. And when you think about hospitals, you have to remember they’re businesses. If you have an empty bed in a hospital, that’s a bed that’s not generating revenue. So hospitals try to operate pretty full. A lot of the ones I’ve been talking to tend to operate, particularly now in the middle of flu season, at like a 95 percent capacity.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nThat means there isn’t a lot of slack in the system to surge up when you have a lot of patients who need care at once. Because hospitals are already generally so full, they just don’t have these empty beds sitting around for patients to use.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nBut now we’re seeing that not having slack in our health care system, not having empty beds that could be used when the need for health care surges, that leaves us really vulnerable in a situation like coronavirus, where you actually really want some slack in the system to treat those extra patients.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK, so that brings us to what I think is probably one of the scariest and most urgent problems of this pandemic, which is ventilators.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nRight. Ventilators are a crucial tool in fighting coronavirus. And the story of why we don’t have enough of them, it highlights probably better than anything else this incredible tension between the business of American health care and the ability to respond to a crisis.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back. So, Sarah, what is the story behind our shortage in ventilators?\n\nsarah kliff\n\nSo in 2006, the federal government creates an entire new division just to prepare medical responses to whatever sort of disasters it can imagine.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nAnd in its first year of operation, they started thinking about how to expand the number of ventilators. They thought that we would need about 70,000 extra machines in a moderate flu pandemic. And one of the things they noticed is that we did have some ventilators in a national stockpile, but they weren’t really ideal. They were big, they were expensive, so you couldn’t order a lot more of them. They required a lot of training. So they come up with this idea that the federal government should develop a ventilator that is the opposite of all of that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo the U.S. is going to get into the business of making its own ventilators.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nExactly. Well, they’re going to outsource it. So they’re going to find a private partner who already makes ventilators and asks them to design something to their specifications. And what they want is a machine that is cheap, that is lightweight, so you can move it around, that doesn’t require a lot of training to use. And they set out to find a private company that is willing to build such a ventilator. And a small medical device company in California called Newport Medical raises their hand, and they are really excited about it. They think it would be really prestigious to work with the government. They want to build this device, and they get the contract.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nFor the first two years, things go pretty well. Newport Medical actually creates three working prototypes, and they ship them out to Washington, D.C., where officials are excited. They see this thing they wanted to build, and they can start envisioning it as part of the national stockpile.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nSo everything really seems to be going as planned until May 2012. That’s when it’s announced that Newport Medical is being purchased by a much larger medical device company called Covidien. Newport Medical was worth about $100 million. Covidien was worth $26 billion dollars.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nJust a magnitude larger company that makes all sorts of devices, whereas Newport Medical, the only thing they did was make ventilators.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nThe government officials who worked on the contract say they saw kind of an immediate change in how things were going. The larger company didn’t seem quite as interested. They requested more money to finish the contract. And at the end of the day, late 2013, early 2014, the contract just falls apart, and the ventilator is never built.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm. Sarah, what’s your sense of why this larger company, Covidien, didn’t want to make this ventilator? I mean, if it was prestigious enough for this little company, why wasn’t it prestigious enough for this bigger company?\n\nsarah kliff\n\nYeah, when I talked to former government officials, they had a sense that Covidien didn’t want to manufacturer a lower cost ventilator that would compete against their higher cost ventilators that were already in the market. You know, it doesn’t make a lot of sense for them as a business to introduce a product that’s going to earn less money into the marketplace.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo basically it wasn’t economically advantageous for this big company.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nExactly. Even more than that, it was economically disadvantageous to have this other product on the market. Covidien executives, they tell a different story. They felt like the government had unrealistic expectations. That when they came in, purchased this small company, they realized this project was just not feasible and ultimately had to negotiate their way out of it with the government. In any case, once this company was purchased, the contract was never finished and the ventilator that was supposed to be designed was not designed.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo all of a sudden, this ahead-of-its-time, pre-planned program to make sure the U.S. has enough ventilators is not producing ventilators that the U.S. may eventually need.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nRight. And the government does keep trying. They redid the contract after this one falls apart, and they award it to Philips, another very large company. The thing is, it was too late for the crisis that we’re in right now.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nSo we’re in a situation where the government spent 13 years, about $20 million trying to build a device that could respond to a pandemic outbreak, and we don’t currently have any ventilators to show for it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm. And so where does that leave the United States’s stockpile of ventilators? How many do we have versus how many we expect to be needing in this moment?\n\nsarah kliff\n\nThere are about 16,000 ventilators in the national stockpile that have been serviced recently, are ready to go out to American hospitals if needed. But back in 2007, when this whole effort started, the government estimated we’d need about 70,000 ventilators. So we’re obviously still quite short of that number.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what is the federal government doing in the face of this ventilator shortage?\n\nsarah kliff\n\nSo they are figuring out how to best use the stockpile. That effort is a little bit mysterious to the public. We don’t exactly know which states are going to get which ventilators, when they will be released and how that will roll out. What is happening a little more publicly, and would likely produce more ventilators, is companies ramping up their production of new units.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Thank you very much. It’s great to have you.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nYou really see that in two ways. One is trying to get other manufacturers, particularly the car manufacturers, to start making ventilators.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) This afternoon, I invoked the Defense Production Act to compel General Motors to accept, perform and prioritize federal contracts for ventilators.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nThis is something President Trump has put some pressure on the industry, on General Motors to start doing.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) This invocation of the D.P.A. should demonstrate clearly to all that we will not hesitate to use the full authority of the federal government to combat this crisis.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nAnd while it is well-intentioned, it’s an effort that’s going to be pretty challenged.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhy?\n\nsarah kliff\n\nWell, the thing to know about ventilators is they’re complex machines that really cannot malfunction. We’re talking about machines with hundreds of parts, that if they stop working, a patient stops breathing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nSo you need them to be put together correctly, and you need all those hundreds of parts to be at the exact right spot. That’s not something a technician learns to do overnight. So when I’ve talked to some of these ventilator manufacturers, asking them, do you think an automobile company could make these, they’re a little bit skeptical.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nThey worry that the expertise isn’t there, and some training is really going to have to happen before you can turn a car assembly line into a ventilator assembly line. The other thing we see happening is the ventilator manufacturers themselves ramping up. They are adding second shifts. They are bringing in more workers. But that’s really limited by labor supply. One of the things that’s really hard right now is you’re trying to bring workers into a factory in the exact moment when the government is asking people to stay home. So increasing work at a factory means providing protective equipment to those employees. It means doing temperature checks when they come into the factory to make sure nobody gets sick. When I talk to ventilator manufacturers, the key constraint they’re facing isn’t enough assembly lines. It’s enough people to work on those assembly lines and who have the knowledge to work on those lines. That’s really what stands between us and having a larger number of ventilators.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo despite all this activity we’re hearing about, despite the invocation of the Defense Production Act, despite car companies saying they’re going to start making ventilators, I’m hearing you say that there’s not going to be tens of thousands of ventilators suddenly rolling off some assembly line and solving this shortage in the next couple of weeks.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nExactly. And I think that’s why you see hospitals experimenting with how to expand the work of the ventilators they have. Some of those experiments are using one ventilator to support multiple patients. Another one is taking the anesthesia machines that would be used in surgery, and with elective surgery being canceled, retooling those as ventilators. These are not things that would be happening if it were business as normal, but it’s obviously not business as normal. And because the hospitals, particularly those in New York, are waiting for ventilators, they’re starting to see how they can expand the capacity of the ventilators that they already have.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSarah, the three examples that you have take us through — the masks, the hospital beds, the ventilators — each of them seems to share the common theme that our preparedness for something like this pandemic, which people been warning about for so long, was undermined by the simple fact that our health care system is driven by profits.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nRight. The thing to know about American hospitals, about device makers, is they’re just like any other business. They have to turn a profit and bring in revenue to stay open. But there’s also something that makes them really different. We absolutely need them in a pandemic situation like the one we’re in now, in a way we don’t quite as much need restaurants and car makers and other manufacturers. They’re playing a crucial role in our safety net, but at the end of the day, we don’t have a tool we’re using to prevent them from being what they are, which is businesses.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo, Sarah, there is a corner of our economy where everything you have just described is true, and yet the federal government always finds a way to make sure it gets what it needs. And that is the military. There is a principle in the United States that the U.S. military has to be able to fight multiple wars at the same time, and the United States government and our taxpayer dollars make sure that that always happens. So we know this is possible. It’s just that the government hasn’t tried that, it seems, when it comes to a stockpile for health care.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nI think a lot of public health officials would agree with that. The ones I’ve talked to say that if we wanted to, of course we could build a giant national stockpile. It’s a question of priorities and a question of funding.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nThey see the cycle that happens to the United States, where there’s a bad pandemic disease, it reveals flaws in our system, and suddenly lawmakers are talking about wanting to commit a lot of money. But the money never quite seems to come through. A year or two later, there are other things they want to spend government money on. It kind of fades into the background until the next pandemic hits. Right now, we seem to treat military threats as real, as something we need to be prepared against.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nWe don’t really treat public health threats the same way. But I think what one of the lessons of coronavirus might be is that the public health threats are just as real as the military ones, and it takes a lot of planning and a lot of money to be prepared for them.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThank you, Sarah.\n\nsarah kliff\n\nThanks, Michael.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe Times reports that in response to the shortages, the Trump administration has begun airlifting supplies of protective gear, including masks and gowns, from China to the United States. The White House said it would make 22 such flights by early April. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. As deaths from the coronavirus climbed in Italy and Spain, both countries tightened restrictions on the movements of their citizens. Spain called for a period of quote, “hibernation,” saying that only essential workers could leave their homes, while Italy said that its national lockdown would be extended until the middle of April.\n\narchived recording (roberto speranza) [SPEAKING ITALIAN]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDuring an interview, Italy’s health minister, Roberto Speranza, warned that loosening the restrictions too soon would, quote, “burn everything we’ve obtained until now.” In the U.S., the virus is now spreading to Midwestern cities like Detroit, where there have been at least 35 deaths and 500 police officers are now under quarantine.\n\narchived recording (mike duggan) There’s no question that we have more density, and we’re more at risk. You’re also seeing the Chicago area and the New Orleans area are also hotspots, and you’re going to see this again and again.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday Detroit’s mayor Mike Duggan predicted that many mid-sized American cities would be next.\n\narchived recording (mike duggan) Major cities in America that are destinations, that lots of people come into are likely to develop. And I think it’s a matter of time before you see Philadelphia and Houston and some other cities develop the same way.\n\nmichael barbaro",

Cases in the U.S. have climbed to almost 2,000, even with sparse testing, and the death toll has risen to 41.\n\nThere are signs that we are still much closer to the beginning of the outbreak than the end. Our colleague Sheri Fink reported today that officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have projected that in a worst-case situation, 160 million to 214 million people in the U.S. could be infected.\n\nThe projections suggest that 2.4 million to 21 million people in the U.S. could require hospitalization, potentially crushing the nation’s medical system, which has only about 925,000 staffed hospital beds, in an outbreak that could last months or even over a year.\n\nThose dire scenarios are not guaranteed to come true. They don’t account for interventions that are now underway: increased testing, tracing contacts of infected people, and limiting social interactions by banning large gatherings and encouraging people to stay home.

    "article_text": "Can you imagine the sigh of relief when there’s an effective coronavirus vaccine? Given the intensity of the news cycle right now, it’s not actually so hard to imagine we might have an international moment like the one that came when the Salk trial results were announced: banner headlines, church bells ringing. A medical V-Day, where V meant both vaccine and victory, over a feared and previously deadly enemy.\n\nFor most of us alive now, it’s a new experience to be longing for a vaccine. The success of the Ebola vaccine (approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2019) was a great and speedy achievement, but I’m not sure that the general public in the United States was profoundly aware of it, or profoundly relieved. And the vaccines that have been added into the schedule in recent years work wonderfully, but it’s not clear that people were living in fear, waiting and hoping for an HPV vaccine, or even a meningitis vaccine. One vaccine that many people wished for urgently — but that never arrived — was an H.I.V. vaccine, which is still not close.\n\nYes, there was powerful advocacy by people whose children’s lives had been destroyed by meningitis (the so-called meningitis vaccine actually specifically works against one very particular bacteria, Neisseria meningitidis, so named for its propensity to cause meningitis). But it wasn’t something that had the general public terrorized, as polio terrorized parents in the 1930s and 1940s and 1950s.\n\n“Right after the vaccine was described as safe, potent and effective, Jonas Salk was invited to the White House,” to meet President Eisenhower, Dr. Oshinsky said. “And for the first time in anyone’s memory, Ike really choked up, thanked him for saving the children of the world, and that really is just a high moment in science, it’s hard to imagine the gratitude people felt.”\n\nIf we get a vaccine for the coronavirus, it will immediately make our world a safer, easier, more reassuring place once again. Science will have solved a problem, so that we can once more walk (and fly and sail) more comfortably through the world — at least until the next problem comes along.",

They asked to remain anonymous, because what they’re doing could put them and their families at great risk. But these people are part of a new wave of Chinese citizens, fighting to get the message out in a country that aggressively censors information. Accounts or messages like these calling for free speech are quickly scrubbed from the internet. Or videos like this, showing people frustrated about life under lockdown. [clanging] Posted online one day, but gone the next. But the crisis over the coronavirus is changing the landscape, for now at least. Everyday citizens are preserving and reposting information the government doesn’t want out there. Experts say this kind of digital resistance is happening at a scale they’ve never seen before. Social media networks like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are blocked in China. But internet savvy people use techniques that allow them to repost censored content to these platforms, while staying under the radar of authorities. They’re creating a visual archive by preserving videos like this one, showing overwhelmed hospitals. [screaming] And they’re reposting people’s personal stories. Some are also turning to less obvious platforms, including GitHub, which is a site mostly used by coders. Another taboo Chinese citizens are pushing back on? They’re making open and widespread calls for freedom of speech. These were triggered by the death of Dr. Li Wenliang. He was an early whistleblower who warned about the virus, and was punished by officials for speaking out. He died in early February from the coronavirus. Right after his death, the hashtag “I want freedom of speech” started to trend on Weibo, a Chinese social media site. Then, it was quickly censored by the government. Dr. Li’s become an icon in the online fight for freedom of speech between censors and citizens. So, who’s winning? For now, citizens are staying a step ahead of the authorities. But a renewed government crackdown could test the strength of this digital resistance.",

    "article_text": "First and foremost: Early and persistent testing helps. And so does tracking people.\n\nTake the country’s first recorded case. On Jan. 28, a man in Bavaria who works for a car parts company that has two plants in Wuhan, China, was confirmed to have the virus. Within two days, the authorities identified the person who had infected the patient, tracked his contacts and quarantined them. The company stopped travel to China and shut down its plant in Bavaria. The outbreak — several other employees tested positive — was effectively contained. Across the country, the pattern was repeated. Local health departments and federal authorities worked together to test, track and quarantine exposed citizens.\n\nGermany has also been better at protecting its older residents, who are at much greater risk. States banned visits to the elderly, and policymakers issued urgent warnings to limit contact with older people. Many seem to have quarantined themselves. The results are clear: Patients over the age of 80 make up around 3 percent of the infected, though they account for 7 percent of the population. The median age for those infected is estimated to be 46; in Italy, it’s 63.\n\nAnd many more young people in Germany have tested positive for the virus than in other countries. In part, that’s attributable to the country’s more extensive testing. But there’s also an element of chance and culture. Germany is a skiing nation — around 14.5 million Germans go skiing every year — and the Austrian and northern Italian Alps are popular locations. This year, after vacationers traveled to one of the centers of the European outbreak, Tyrol, they seemed to bring back the virus with them — and spread it.\n\nCloser to home, there’s carnival. One of the most substantial early outbreaks occurred at one of the centers of carnival, which involves parades and parties, popular with the young. Hundreds of cases seem to be traceable to a couple who took part in festivities in the town of Langbroich. “Both skiing and carnival may have affected the low average age of the first wave of confirmed cases,” said Karl Lauterbach, a physician and a member of the Bundestag.\n\nBoth early testing and incubation of the virus among the young go part of the way in explaining why the country’s fatality rate is so comparatively low. “It’s how much and whom we test,” Martin Stürmer, a virologist who is the director of a lab that is running coronavirus testing in Frankfurt, told me. In general, countries that test less and reserve it for those already very ill, like Italy, have higher fatality rates.",

Katz’s suggestion that the global community is overreacting to Covid-19. He favors letting the pandemic run its course, but somehow “walling off” the most vulnerable. He argues that his strategy would preserve the global economy, while stemming deaths from Covid-19. We disagree.\n\nFirst, it is not yet known who all of the most vulnerable people are. We believe that it is easier, quicker and more efficient to reduce transmission over all than to permit high levels of transmission in the community but somehow keep it from afflicting susceptible people in our highly networked world.\n\nSecond, it is likely that more intense transmission among younger people, who Dr. Katz suggests should be freed of most social-distancing restrictions, would result in many more of their deaths, especially as hospitals become overwhelmed.\n\nThird, allowing the virus to spread uninhibited across a wide swath of our country might eliminate any hope we might have of snuffing out viral transmission into a new respiratory virus season next winter.",

    "article_text": "It probably began with an accident thousands of years ago. According to one legend, rain washed the fat and ash from frequent animal sacrifices into a nearby river, where they formed a lather with a remarkable ability to clean skin and clothes. Perhaps the inspiration had a vegetal origin in the frothy solutions produced by boiling or mashing certain plants. However it happened, the ancient discovery of soap altered human history. Although our ancestors could not have foreseen it, soap would ultimately become one of our most effective defenses against invisible pathogens.\n\nPeople typically think of soap as gentle and soothing, but from the perspective of microorganisms, it is often extremely destructive. A drop of ordinary soap diluted in water is sufficient to rupture and kill many types of bacteria and viruses, including the new coronavirus that is currently circling the globe. The secret to soap’s impressive might is its hybrid structure.\n\nSoap is made of pin-shaped molecules, each of which has a hydrophilic head — it readily bonds with water — and a hydrophobic tail, which shuns water and prefers to link up with oils and fats. These molecules, when suspended in water, alternately float about as solitary units, interact with other molecules in the solution and assemble themselves into little bubbles called micelles, with heads pointing outward and tails tucked inside.\n\nSome bacteria and viruses have lipid membranes that resemble double-layered micelles with two bands of hydrophobic tails sandwiched between two rings of hydrophilic heads. These membranes are studded with important proteins that allow viruses to infect cells and perform vital tasks that keep bacteria alive. Pathogens wrapped in lipid membranes include coronaviruses, H.I.V., the viruses that cause hepatitis B and C, herpes, Ebola, Zika, dengue, and numerous bacteria that attack the intestines and respiratory tract.",

    "article_text": "michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”\n\n[music]\n\nToday: A suburb north of New York City has become one of the largest clusters of the coronavirus in the U.S. My colleague, Sarah Maslin Nir, went there. It’s Thursday, March 19.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSarah, tell us about the past few weeks in this town of New Rochelle, New York.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIt began with a local man. His name is Larry Garbuz. He’s a lawyer. He’s about 50, lives in New Rochelle, which is this suburb about five or so miles north of New York City’s border. And he falls ill about February 27, and he starts to decline pretty rapidly. He asks a neighbor to drive him to the hospital and spends several days there really spiraling. Then on March 2, they find out what was wrong with Larry Garbuz, and it was coronavirus.\n\n[music]\n\narchived recording Cases of coronavirus are growing nationwide, and New York state is no exception.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nHe’s the first person in this suburb that is diagnosed.\n\narchived recording Investigators scrambling to retrace the patient’s movements from the Bronxville hospital where he was first treated.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd disease investigators then have to trace his movements.\n\narchived recording The week before he knew he was contagious, the married father of four traveled around the New York City area. He also attended temple services back in Westchester.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd found out that he had attended religious services, just as anyone would — a wedding, a bar mitzvah — about a week before.\n\narchived recording Synagogue Young Israel of New Rochelle ordered to close, and hundreds of people who attended services there have been told to quarantine themselves at home.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd the Westchester County Health Department ordered a hundred families, congregants at that synagogue, to self-quarantine.\n\n[music]\n\nSo I’m sitting in our offices at Times Square when we hear about this diagnosis, and I immediately get in my car and head up to New Rochelle. Because this is going to have huge ripple effects in his town. We know it. And when I arrived, people didn’t even know it had happened. There was a man pushing at the door of Young Israel, Mr. Garbuz’s synagogue, trying to get in for evening prayers, not understanding why it was locked. There were restaurants, where people should be turning up for evening hours, not understanding why their customers were calling in takeout instead. This was a town where the news that they were part of this global pandemic was just settling in.\n\nspeaker But there’s nothing we can do about it. I think it’s another flu that’s going to go away, hopefully. sarah maslin nir Mm-hmm.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nPeople were barely understanding that this had happened to them.\n\nspeaker And I’m still going to go out. I’m going to go to CVS, the post office, the bank, because — I’m going to wash my hands. I’m going to try never to ever touch my face. I’m going to live my life.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo to the degree that something is happening here in New Rochelle, it’s dawning on people very slowly.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI think it’s dawning on America very slowly, and New Rochelle was a reflection of the lack of seriousness with which the country was taking this threat.\n\n[music]\n\nBut from that quiet first evening in New Rochelle, things rapidly began to change.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) Good afternoon. New Rochelle is a particular problem.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd on March 10, something unprecedented happens.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) What we are going to do is focus on an area, a concentric circle around —\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nA one-mile radius containment zone is designated in New Rochelle, surrounding the neighborhood of this first patient.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) Facilities within that area, schools within that area would be closed for two weeks. We’ll go in, we’ll clean the schools and assess the situation. This can’t be a political decision. This is a public health decision.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nThat containment zone is the red hot center of New York’s coronavirus outbreak.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) We’re also going to use the National Guard in the containment area.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd then, in comes the National Guard.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) It is a dramatic action, but it is the largest cluster in the country. And this is literally a matter of life and death. That’s not an overly rhetorical statement.\n\n[music]\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nYou have people holed up in their homes, people needing testing, needing health care, needing the basic necessities of life and affected by this virus that dramatically curtails their movements. I wanted to understand, how is the government keeping us safe? How are the health care workers carrying out testing? And how are the people of New Rochelle coping?\n\nsarah maslin nir I’m standing on Lincoln Avenue, which is just outside the containment zone in New Rochelle, where a huge truck full of hundreds and thousands of pounds of food has just arrived. About six uniformed members of the National Guard are standing outside this truck as a pallet is unloaded full of —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Sarah, why exactly is the National Guard there? What is their official mission? When I think the National Guard being dispatched, it’s usually after a natural disaster and they are literally there to pick up the pieces.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nYeah. These men and women had been to floods. They’d been to earthquakes. They’d been to hurricane zones. This is the first-ever time they were called to an epidemic event.\n\nmember of the national guard So we’re basically responding to all natural disasters in New York state —\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd they were called here for two main purposes, which is to deliver meals to people bound in their homes by quarantine, and to clean.\n\nsarah maslin nir So I’ve just walked into the Jewish Community Center on Wilmot Road in Scarsdale. Inside, 60 members of the National Guard are doing a deep clean.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI watched them clean at a community center, and the meticulousness was really incredible.\n\nmember of the national guard I’m currently going to inform the process of sanitizing the equipment. First, you have to take the equipment and put it into the solution of water and bleach.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI walk into a classroom for children, and there are these men and women squeezed in their military gear into teeny, tiny plastic seats for toddlers, poring over piles of building blocks and Legos and scrubbing each block by hand.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe National Guard is scrubbing children’s toys?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nYeah, it was an uncanny sight. They did this kind of thing throughout the containment zone — cleaning synagogues, city facilities, community centers, scrubbing ceilings, floors, chairs, anything that a sick person may have touched.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, Sarah, as you’re describing this, the National Guard is on the ground. Local officials are still theoretically in charge. Right? Like the people who run the city, probably even the county. So is it clear to you who is in charge, and is this all coordinated?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIn the early moments of New Rochelle coming to terms with this new reality, it was a lot of moving pieces. It was a city in turmoil with no real leadership structure in place at that moment. But I get in my car, and I drive down to downtown New Rochelle to the headquarters of the Westchester County Health Department and discover that something had been building here all along.\n\nsarah maslin nir I’m standing inside of the incident response center in New Rochelle, and there’s a group of about 30 nurses on folding chairs getting a briefing about their deployment to test people who are quarantined at home. speaker Make sure go to the bathroom. Wash your hands properly before you do anything. Take breaks. You don’t have to rush around. We want to make sure that you are taking care of each other and —\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd there I come upon a huge, bustling incident command center.\n\nsarah maslin nir They’re going out in groups of three, in protective gear with swab kits.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is there. The room is filled with nurses. There is an assembly line of test gear, and test kits, and what’s called P.P.E. — personal protective equipment. People are filing around the room equipping themselves to get ready to deploy to the houses of sick people to test them for coronavirus.\n\nsarah maslin nir And they’re all asking lots of very understandable questions. nurse Is there going to be an influx of testing, or it’s just, like, we’re only doing New Rochelle? sarah maslin nir How do we make sure these people feel safe? How do we make sure that we’re safe as we go out onto the front lines?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nSo at this point, in the United States only 25,000 people had been tested for coronavirus. And this command center is to send that number way up. So people will call into their doctors, tell their symptoms. They’ll get put on a list. And every so often, these groups of nurses were getting an address, information. They’d put on head-to-toe protective gear and head out to sample and test those people. And there are big signs that say, “We’ve got this.”\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe signs actually say, “We’ve got this?”\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nHandwritten signs all over the room.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what are you thinking when you see this?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI think I’ve finally found the coordinated response that this situation seems to call for.\n\n[music]\n\nThis is a room full of all the layers of government, from the state, to different agencies, to health care workers in their scrubs, coordinating to take on this crisis head-on. And after nearly a week of frightened townspeople and scared kids, this is exactly what you wanted to see. It was a relief.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Sarah, what happens next?\n\narchived recording What else can you tell us about this containment plan? archived recording (andrew cuomo) Think of it this way. We have 173 cases in the entire state. Right? We have 108 in New Rochelle.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAt this point, things are starting to get up and running in New Rochelle. We’re about two weeks out from the first diagnosis, and the National Guard is here. There is the incident command center. And that command center is sending people out to do in-home testing.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) — do what we have to do. But you know, Jake, this is a microcosm of what we’re going to be looking at. The numbers are going to go up consistently, because our testing is way behind the reality of what the situation is.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nBut still, it’s not enough. The numbers of people tested at this point are only in the hundreds.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) China was doing 10,000 tests per day. This country, in total we’ve done about 5,000 tests. So we really have to get that testing capacity up if we’re going to make the difference.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nNew York state recognizes even what they’re doing there in New Rochelle, it’s not enough. We have to ramp up testing.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so how do they actually do that?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nActually, they saw what was happening in South Korea, where they’ve created these highly effective drive-through testing centers, managing to churn out 275,000 since diagnosis. And that happened, actually, around the same time that our country had its first case. So New York state decides we need these centers. And so I went to see this myself.\n\nsarah maslin nir So I’m recording this now standing outside the mobile drive-through testing center in a public park called Glen Island in Rochester.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nWhen you get to this beautiful island park, there’s seagulls wheeling overhead. There’s the Long Island Sound glinting. You arrive at what looks like three beautiful wedding tents. They’re tents that could be for any garden party. And you only realize what this is because of the cop who stops you at the drawbridge to this island with his megaphone blaring.\n\ncop Are you here for testing? Yes? OK. Keep your windows rolled up at all times. Have your ID ready. Windows rolled up at all times, windows closed at all times. Have your ID ready. You’re going over the drawbridge, and stay to the right. sarah maslin nir Thank you for helping us. chuck hamilton Sure.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nMy guide was a gentleman by the name of Chuck Hamilton. He was in charge of operations at that site.\n\nchuck hamilton There is three tents with six lanes. We’re being directed by our National Guard personnel right now.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd as we pulled up, you head down a meandering lane lined with orange cones and members of the National Guard and other police forces.\n\nchuck hamilton — will advise us to keep our windows closed at this particular point.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nThey demanded I put my ID on the windshield.\n\nchuck hamilton Windows closed up. sarah maslin nir Sir? government official Put your IDs up on the dash. chuck hamilton OK. All identification must now be put on the dash.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nThey don’t want you to open your window, hand them anything. So groups of people in Tyvek aprons, those respirator masks, lean over, peer through your windshield, tap your name and info into a tablet, and make sure you’re confirmed for your appointment at the drive-through testing center.\n\nchuck hamilton — stage two. sarah maslin nir And there are two silver — chuck hamilton These people are in full Tyvek hooded suits.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nNext, you’re waved from this first zone where they check you in, called a cold zone because there isn’t a risk of contamination there, to the hot zone.\n\nsarah maslin nir — full body suits? chuck hamilton Yes, these are all registered nurses, paramedics, or E.M.T.s. She’s indicating when you’re — you keep the window closed.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIn the hot zone, I was approached by two nurses in full, what looked to me like hazmat suits, eye shields, heads covered, every seal wrapped up tightly to make sure nothing could get through. I rolled down my window.\n\nnurse This is section two. So there’s section one, intake —\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd they told me what they would do if I were in fact sick, which was tip my head back, thread a swab into my nostril and then another into the back of my throat with a tongue depressor, put those swabs in vials, and send those off to the lab.\n\nnurse I’d tell you to lean forward and tilt your head a little bit backwards, take a deep breath. I’m going to put the swab in. And that’s it. The other swab is the backup control.\n\n[music]\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI rolled up my window tightly and then moved on to the next station, where I was processed. And a woman held up a little handwritten sign that said, “Feel better.” I imagine that everybody else going through that line needed that sign real bad.\n\nsarah maslin nir So you’re in total protective gear. You’re doing this work. You’re on the front of the front of the front line. How do you feel?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI spoke to one nurse who was in that hazmat suit in the hot zone. And she appeared to me to be the age demographic that is at risk from coronavirus, which is 50-plus. And yet she felt this was the moment to step up.\n\nlisa I feel compelled to help, compelled to help. And you know, we have to be careful. One mistake could be a big problem, obviously. We can become contaminated. But this is the time — this is why we became nurses. This is the time to help. If we don’t do this, what do we do? sarah maslin nir What’s your name? lisa My name is Lisa —\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIf I’m not here, what am I doing?\n\nsarah maslin nir Can you spell the last name? lisa B, A, E, Z. And then hyphen —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo has this testing site been effective? Is it making a difference in containing and combating the virus?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIt is making a difference in figuring out who has this illness — and a tremendous difference. They have hustled, since it opened on Friday, 2,849 people through that drive-through as of our conversation, Michael. This is charging ahead and vastly increasing New York’s capacity to test these people. This is how we’re going to get a handle on this disease. To understand how it spreads, who’s affected by it, to model it forward, to know what we’re up against.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. You really can’t stop it until you can measure it.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nExactly. And you can’t protect people unless you know who’s got it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Sarah, at this point, the system that you have described to handle this acute crisis in New Rochelle is containment zone, the National Guard to keep it contained, but more importantly, keep people safe, clean, fed. And now there’s this mobile testing center nearby trying to figure out just how widely the virus has spread. Overall, is this starting to feel like a model for other places?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nMore than just feel like a model, it is the model for New York state’s response. In the coming week and weeks, more of exactly what’s happening in New Rochelle is going to be set up all over the state. Nassau County, Jones Beach, which isn’t too far, just got its first mobile testing center modeled off this. It’s coming to Staten Island in New York City, to Rockland County, another place not far away.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI met a man while I was out there in New Rochelle. We were standing outside a classroom where National Guard were scrubbing Legos. And he said to me, you know, they talk about reinventing the wheel, but this is inventing the wheel. And when we look back at how to handle these things in the future, people are going to look back and say, how did they do it in New Rochelle? And he might be right. The whole country might end up looking at this as a model, because the whole country might be in New Rochelle’s position soon. And this may be just what they have to go on.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd do you get the sense that what’s happening in New Rochelle — this invention of the wheel when it comes to how to deal with a pandemic in the United States — do you get the sense that it’s working and that this is basically all on the right track?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIt’s hard to know. Every day there are new cases. I don’t think we’ll know for a while what’s working. But it’s deeply comforting when you look out across the nation and the world and see this patchwork of responses that barely hang together, to know that here in this state, in this city, in New Rochelle, a herculean effort is being made to get this thing right and keep people safe.\n\nsarah maslin nir I am walking down North Avenue in New Rochelle. It’s the same block where the synagogue at the heart of this outbreak, Young Israel of New Rochelle sits closed at the other end of the street. And walking —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, Sarah, we have been talking about how this town has been totally transformed in what’s really just a matter of days, a couple weeks. A lot of outsiders coming in — National Guard, volunteers parachuting in to help. But what about the community itself? The people who are there in the city, in this containment zone, how are they handling this?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nMichael, this is a hard time to be anyone, in or out of the zone. And we are all looking for a dose of human goodness.\n\nsarah maslin nir And we were just talking outside. It’s a little intimidating, huh? A little scary? speaker 1 Mm-hmm. sarah maslin nir How do you feel about it? speaker 1 Sad. sarah maslin nir Why? speaker 1 Because people’s dying. sarah maslin nir But I want you to know that that’s just a very few older people. And I don’t want you to feel scared. Do you — speaker 1 I’m not scared. sarah maslin nir You’re not?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIf you go to New Rochelle and you see people asked unimaginable things, asked to cut themselves off from everyone they love to protect everyone else, you see people willingly doing it.\n\nsarah maslin nir How are you holding up? speaker 2 We’ve been doing a lot of deliveries. As you can see, there’s no one in the restaurant right now except you and I and some staff.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nPeople, as much as they’ve been put upon and wish it were otherwise, they are resolute and resilient. And they’re accepting this because they know it’s for a greater purpose.\n\nspeaker 2 We just want to make sure that the stress level and the anguish that the public might be feeling, that they feel that everything that can be done is being done for their health. sarah maslin nir Are you helping out too? speaker 1 Yeah. sarah maslin nir Are you going to pack any bags or give any bags to any of the families? speaker 1 Mm-hmm.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nFrom the delivery people who’ve worked out systems to leave bags of food on a staircase and run away with a wave, to the sick people indoors waiting for that meal —\n\nspeaker 3 What we’ve been doing, as I’ve coined the phrase, the drop and dash. So you literally pull up to the house, you drop the bag off, and you run like the wind. And that’s it.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nEverybody gets it. Everybody just wants everyone else to get better.\n\nspeaker 3 — feel like someone cares about them. Yes, they’re quarantined. It’s a terrible thing. And when I pick up the phone, and I see a name that I recognize, I speak to them. I say, how are you holding up? And they ask me the same thing. How are you holding up? And we both crack a joke and we laugh and that’s it. You got to keep a sense of humor with this whole thing. And it’s terrible for everyone. It really — my heart is aching for them, and they feel the same way about me.\n\n[music]\n\nspeaker 3 This whole thing is just bringing everyone together, hopefully not literally because that’s how corona spreads. sarah maslin nir You got to laugh, huh? speaker 3 Yeah. You got to laugh. sarah maslin nir It’s the only way to get through it. speaker 3 100 percent. sarah maslin nir Are you going to go out on another delivery now? speaker 3 Um, I don’t have anything at the moment.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHere’s what else you need to know today. On Wednesday, the United States and Canada said they would close their shared border to all but essential travel, becoming the latest countries to restrict border crossings to slow the spread of the pandemic.\n\narchived recording (justin trudeau) In both our countries, we’re encouraging people to stay home. We’re telling our citizens not to visit their neighbors if they don’t absolutely have to. Well, this collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMeanwhile in Washington, the Senate approved a relief package already passed by the House, that provides sick leave, unemployment benefits, free coronavirus testing, and food and medical aid to Americans affected by the pandemic. President Trump quickly signed the legislation into law, the first of several congressional bills related to the coronavirus that he is expected to support.\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) The Congress has an enormous role to play in responding to this challenge, and we are determined to do that duty.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn a speech from the Senate floor, Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell called for a bipartisan approach to the crisis.\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) This is not a challenge anyone wanted for our nation, but it is a challenge we will overcome. Someday, hopefully soon, our nation will have this virus on its heels.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.\n\n[music]",

    "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/smarter-living/coronavirus-anxiety-tips.html",
    "article_text": "Don’t be afraid to ask for help.\n\nNow is the time to turn toward each other. “We are here to help each other out,” Dr. Lerner reminds us, “so avoid being a do-it-yourselfer when you’re not qualified. Grab some other clear-thinking person to ask what she thinks or what he would do about stockpiling food, or taking that plane trip, or talking to little Billy about what’s going on with grandma in the hospital and his school being closed. You may choose not to follow the advice you seek, but it’s essential to have other perspectives.”\n\nDon’t procrastinate about preparing for the worst.\n\nAnxiety, Dr. Lerner says, can push us to under- or overreact: “So we either engage in compulsive hand washing or we do the opposite and act like the germ theory doesn’t apply to us.” And this anxiety, she says, will mount if we postpone or ignore expert counsel: “Passivity and inaction will make fear grow.” So, instead of giving up and saying, “I can’t keep my hands off my face,” Dr. Lerner suggests we trust our capacity to make necessary changes, recognize where we have agency and take common sense, precautionary measures now. “If you haven’t done your best to get a couple of extra weeks’ supply of food or medication, do it today. If you feel frozen, ask a buddy to push you to act and help you make wise decisions about how much you need of what.”\n\nConnect, connect, connect.\n\nSocial distancing and mandates to shelter in place may require us to stay in our homes, but that doesn’t mean we have to isolate. “It’s essential to stay in communication with family, friends, neighbors and other resources,” Dr. Lerner says, “and find ways to keep calm. Use the phone, text, email — all means possible — to stay connected to friends, neighbors, your adult children, anyone who matters to you. Especially those who induce a sense of calm rather than chaos. People need to hear your voice — and vice versa.”\n\nPractice self-compassion.\n\nThis moment calls on us to not only care for others but to also be gentle with ourselves. “Anxiety and fear,” Dr. Lerner reminds us, “are physiological processes that cavort and careen through our bodies and make us miserable. They will subside, only to return again; they will arrive uninvited for as long as we live. So don’t be hard on yourself when you can’t shut yourself off from fear and pain — your own and the world’s. Fear isn’t fun, but it signals that we are fully human.”\n\nDon’t skip the self-care.\n\n“Everything that goes under the umbrella of ‘self-care’ is essential right now,” Dr. Lerner says. Slow down, engage in healthy practices and try to sustain regular routines that bring comfort and stability. Therapy, conversation, exercise, yoga, meditation and religious and spiritual practices are good starting points, but she suggests also considering the healing impacts of making art, singing, journaling and being useful to others.",

    "article_text": "“The Plague” isn’t trying to panic us, because panic suggests a response to a dangerous but short-term condition from which we can eventually find safety. But there can never be safety — and that is why, for Camus, we need to love our fellow damned humans and work without hope or despair for the amelioration of suffering. Life is a hospice, never a hospital.\n\nAt the height of the contagion, when 500 people a week are dying, a Catholic priest called Paneloux gives a sermon that explains the plague as God’s punishment for depravity. But Dr. Rieux has watched a child die and knows better: Suffering is randomly distributed, it makes no sense, it is simply absurd, and that is the kindest thing one can say of it.\n\nThe doctor works tirelessly to lessen the suffering of those around him. But he is no hero. “This whole thing is not about heroism,” Dr. Rieux says. “It may seem a ridiculous idea, but the only way to fight the plague is with decency.” Another character asks what decency is. “Doing my job,” the doctor replies.\n\nEventually, after more than a year, the plague ebbs away. The townspeople celebrate. Suffering is over. Normality can return. But Dr. Rieux “knew that this chronicle could not be a story of definitive victory,” Camus writes. “It could only be the record of what had to be done and what, no doubt, would have to be done again, against this terror.” The plague, he continues, “never dies”; it “waits patiently in bedrooms, cellars, trunks, handkerchiefs and old papers” for the day when it will once again “rouse its rats and send them to die in some well-contented city.”\n\nCamus speaks to us in our own times not because he was a magical seer who could intimate what the best epidemiologists could not, but because he correctly sized up human nature. He knew, as we do not, that “everyone has it inside himself, this plague, because no one in the world, no one, is immune.”\n\nAlain de Botton is the author, most recently, of “The School of Life.”\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

And it’s a little loud because we have to keep the windows open, because that’s the recommendation in these situations. You have to keep everything ventilated.\n\n[music]\n\namy qin\n\nTwo weeks ago, our researcher Elsie and I went down to Wuhan, which is this major city in the center of China that has been the epicenter of the recent coronavirus outbreak. By then, it had been under lockdown for about a week. And we were really curious to see how people were faring and what was going on, especially at the hospitals there. We took the train from Beijing to Wuhan. And we got off, and what we saw was totally crazy. I mean, we’d never seen anything like it. This is a city of 11 million that had come to a complete standstill. It felt like being in a parallel reality. To see those streets completely empty was really striking. It was eerie to hear the silence. And the only time we heard anything was the occasional barking of a dog or an ambulance passing by. We were walking around this hospital and we walked into the courtyard in front of the outpatient department. And that’s where we came upon this very jarring scene. You had 30 or so patients that were all kind of sitting quietly in the courtyard, all hooked up to IV drips that were hanging from tree branches or in their cars.\n\ninterposing voices [SPEAKING MANDARIN]\n\namy qin\n\nWe meet this mother and her two children who are all hooked up to IVs. The mother’s name is Yang Ling.\n\nyang ling [SPEAKING MANDARIN]\n\namy qin\n\nThey tell me that they are actually a family of six. There’s Yang Ling. There is her husband, her husband’s parents and then their son and their daughter. And they have all been staying together. And she tells us that their grandmother got sick first and one by one, each of them has gotten infected by the coronavirus. And now, her husband is the only one that doesn’t have coronavirus.\n\nyang ling [SPEAKING MANDARIN]\n\namy qin\n\nAnd then they tell me that just one week after the grandmother started showing symptoms, their grandfather died.\n\nyang ling [SPEAKING MANDARIN]\n\namy qin\n\nShe tells us that after the grandfather dies, the funeral home comes to take the body away —\n\nyang ling [SPEAKING MANDARIN]\n\namy qin\n\n— and he is cremated immediately. And she says that —\n\nyang ling [SPEAKING MANDARIN]\n\namy qin\n\n— he was taken away just like a dead dog or a dead pig.\n\nyang ling [SPEAKING MANDARIN]\n\namy qin\n\nAs she’s talking, her voice is starting to carry across the courtyard outside this hospital. And other people are starting to listen in and crowd around us, and she’s starting to get more and more upset. She was so palpably angry that at one point —\n\nyang ling [SPEAKING MANDARIN]\n\namy qin\n\n— the mother was waving her arms around in frustration and almost ripped the IV needle out of her hand.\n\nyang ling [SPEAKING MANDARIN]\n\namy qin\n\nI’ve been covering China for seven years. And I’ve heard people express frustrations with the government before, but really only in private. This was one of the few times that I’ve heard such raw anger toward the government publicly.\n\nyang ling [SPEAKING MANDARIN]\n\namy qin\n\nAnd she basically says, is this really my country or is this some kind of [EXPLETIVE] up country — a country that doesn’t take care of anything?\n\nyang ling [SPEAKING MANDARIN].\n\namy qin\n\nAnd then she says, what kind of government is this? And after hearing that, that made me think that something was happening that was bigger than just an outbreak of a virus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: Inside China, what began as a story of fear over the coronavirus has now become the story of fury over the government’s handling of the crisis. Beijing correspondent Amy Qin on what she saw in Wuhan. It’s Thursday, February 13. Amy, what is it about this moment that you think is making people like the Zhang family feel free to speak out about their anger and to pretty explicitly criticize the Chinese government?\n\namy qin\n\nSo for the Zhang family, this is for them a matter of life or death. And it was a common feeling I heard throughout the city. But there’s another added frustration boiling across the rest of the country about how the government is handling this crisis. And for them, it’s really been captured in the story of this doctor named Dr. Li Wenliang.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd who is this doctor?\n\namy qin\n\nSo Li Wenliang is an eye doctor at a hospital in Wuhan. And he had heard about this virus back in December that was going around the hospitals in the city. And so he went on WeChat, which is this big social messaging platform, and sent in a private messaging group with some of his med school classmates a text message basically warning them to protect themselves. And a few days later after he sent that message, he was actually called in by the police in Wuhan. They brought him into the police station and they made him sign a statement saying that he was spreading false and illegal information — basically, that he was spreading rumors.\n\narchived recording Authorities say it is untrue and eight people were detained for spreading fake news online and no medical staff had been infected.\n\namy qin\n\nBut of course, it wasn’t a rumor.\n\narchived recording Chinese health authorities are still working to identify the virus behind a pneumonia outbreak in the central city of Wuhan.\n\namy qin\n\nBy the time Dr. Li was brought into the police station, 41 people had the coronavirus. And from there, it just spread.\n\narchived recording 1 A SARS-like virus, which has infected hundreds in China, has now reached the United States. archived recording 2 Now China has announced the first death from an outbreak of pneumonia caused by an unidentified virus. archived recording 3 121 people are under medical observation in Wuhan. Rumors on social media alleged that the outbreak in Wuhan could be linked to SARS. archived recording 4 The World Health Organization says it’s a new type of coronavirus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Amy, at this point, what is happening to Dr. Li?\n\namy qin\n\nSo after Dr. Li gets taken into the police station and forced to sign this statement, he was actually treating a patient for glaucoma. And she wasn’t showing any symptoms at the time, but he ended up contracting the virus from her.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\namy qin\n\nAnd from his sickbed, he starts to speak out again.\n\narchived recording In a matter of days, Dr. Li Wenliang went from treating patients to becoming one.\n\namy qin\n\nHe gives some interviews to Chinese media and he starts to become this public figure.\n\narchived recording Struggling to communicate, Li spoke with CNN briefly by phone. You can hear the hospital machines pulsing in the background.\n\namy qin\n\nHe becomes known as a whistleblower —\n\narchived recording Whistleblowers silenced by police. Calls for Li and the others to be vindicated grew online.\n\namy qin\n\n— that the government didn’t act fast enough on information that they were given, and that they had missed this critical window of opportunity to get the outbreak under control.\n\narchived recording China’s Supreme Court even weighed in, adding quote, “It might have been a fortunate thing if the public had listened to this rumor at the time.” But for many —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo he’s becoming a kind of spokesperson for a lot of frustrations.\n\namy qin\n\nExactly.\n\narchived recording (li wenliang) [INAUDIBLE] [COUGHING]\n\namy qin\n\nAnd so at this point, it just feels like there is no light at the end of the tunnel.\n\narchived recording 1 Now, the death toll in the outbreak of a new coronavirus in China has jumped to 17. archived recording 2 Hundreds of people have been diagnosed with a deadly virus known as the 2019 novel coronavirus. archived recording 3 Overall, there are now more than 31,500 confirmed cases worldwide.\n\namy qin\n\nMore and more people are getting sick. We’re seeing the numbers just surge every day —\n\narchived recording 4 600 deaths.\n\namy qin\n\n— people who are confirmed cases of the coronavirus, people who are dying of the coronavirus.\n\narchived recording 5 Has jumped to more than 700.\n\namy qin\n\nEverything felt so uncertain.\n\narchived recording 6 Officials are imposing restrictions on travel out of Wuhan, China. archived recording 7 And 13 cities in lockdown this morning. archived recording 8 Near-empty shelves line supermarkets. archived recording 9 A need for masks and protective suits. archived recording 10 China’s health minister, Ma Xiaowei, has said that he expects infections to continue to rise. And of course, that has everyone here in the country even more nervous. archived recording 11 The citizens are actually freaking out. archived recording 12 China right now is being massively rocked by anger. archived recording 13 And the State Department has said it is chartering a flight to evacuate Americans out of Wuhan. Justin, though, will not be on that —\n\namy qin\n\nSo foreign governments started pulling their citizens out of Wuhan, and that’s when I got the call. So it was late last week, and I had been on the phone all day with my editors. And I get a final call saying you need to go to the airport. There was one flight left that was being arranged by the U.S. State Department to go back to the U.S., so I start scrambling. I leave all my masks, my disinfectant wipes, my hazmat suit, my gloves with my colleagues. And then it’s about a 40-minute drive to the airport.\n\namy qin O.K. So I am at the airport in Wuhan now. And it’s been a crazy, hectic day. I think that the next few weeks in quarantine on a military base will bring its own interesting moments.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what is the scene at the airport?\n\namy qin\n\nThe scene at the airport was a little bit frenzied. I mean, at this point, these are really some of the last flights out for these countries who are evacuating their citizens, so it wasn’t just the Americans. There were also the Canadians, the Japanese. And we didn’t even know at that point where they were taking us to. So I’m in the airport lobby and I’m waiting for my flight. And then my phone starts to buzz, and I’m seeing all these messages come through. And I look at them, and then I see that Dr. Li has just died. And I could sense that this was going to be a big moment, because I had started overhearing people talking about it in the airport terminal. But then I just had to leave. I had to get on the flight.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back. So Amy, Dr. Li has died from the very virus that he alerted the government to, and you’re on a plane back to the U.S. from Wuhan. So what happens once you land?\n\namy qin\n\nSo once I land, I find that I am at the Miramar Marine base in San Diego, California. I’m carted off to quarantine, and then I turn on my phone and I start going through my messages. And I see this huge upswelling of outrage over Dr. Li’s death. People from every stripe of the political or social spectrum in China — so you have people who are business people, who are blue-collar workers, artists, lawyers — they’re all posting about Dr. Li’s death. And I’ve never seen people come together like this before — and people were so upset about his death.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what are they saying?\n\namy qin\n\nA lot of people were posting candle emojis and other kinds of remembrances for Dr. Li. They were posting photos of him. He had taken a selfie of himself wearing a surgical mask and someone had recreated that image to replace the surgical mask with barbed wire to kind of indicate that he had been muzzled. Some people were posting the anthem from “Les Mis,” “Do you hear the people sing? Singing a song of angry men?”\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\namy qin\n\nWe actually saw the hashtag “I want freedom of speech” trending for five hours, which of course, it was quickly censored. And we saw petitions going up by Chinese academics calling for freedom of speech. And we even saw a local government social media account posting a portrait of Dr. Li, along with the lines, “Heroes don’t fall from the sky. They’re just ordinary people who step forward.”\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\namy qin\n\nSo the reaction is really remarkable. I mean, even the hospital where Dr. Li died posted an official notice of his death. And that had three million reactions and 300,000 comments. And so it was so clear that this was something that had really tapped into the frustration that was happening.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what do you make of those reactions? Because it feels like it no longer is really just about this virus and the way that it was handled?\n\namy qin\n\nYeah so at this point, it is clear that this is becoming so much bigger than just the virus. This is really about the government and this social contract that the people have had with the government, where they agree to keep silent as long as the government provides for their prosperity and health. It operates under this principle of stability at all costs.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. And in their effort to create stability, in fact, they did the opposite.\n\namy qin\n\nYeah. I mean, I think that there’s this realization definitely that there is something wrong with the system. And I don’t think that it means that people are going out in the streets and calling for a revolution. But the fact that people are calling for freedom of speech, I mean, that’s really what this brought out. People in China are already used to a pretty high level of censorship, but when it comes to censoring a warning about public health, that goes too far. And the reaction is so overwhelming that the government quickly realizes that they need to do something. And that’s when we see China’s leader Xi Jinping come forward out of the shadows and try to take control of the situation\n\narchived recording (xi jinping) [SPEAKING CHINESE] [LAUGHTER]\n\namy qin\n\nHe comes out and makes an appearance in Beijing.\n\narchived recording (xi jinping) [SPEAKING CHINESE]\n\namy qin\n\nHe visits a community center and a hospital. He gets his temperature taken. He talks with local residents.\n\narchived recording (xi jinping) [SPEAKING CHINESE]\n\namy qin\n\nAnd he does a video conference with doctors in Wuhan.\n\narchived recording (xi jinping) [SPEAKING CHINESE] [APPLAUSE]\n\namy qin\n\nSo by this point, the government has sent the nation’s top anti-corruption agency to go down to Wuhan and investigate Dr. Li’s death. And state media is calling Dr. Li a hero.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThis feels like a real shift for a government that originally reprimanded Dr. Li and is now sending a team to investigate why he was muzzled. It feels like a concession.\n\namy qin\n\nIt is. But at the same time, we have to remember that this is also part of the party’s ethos, which is to always try to control the narrative. And for them, the path of least resistance in this situation is to hold Dr. Li up as a hero, but also to do it in a way that coheres with the party narrative.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh.\n\namy qin\n\nErasing the parts that might challenge their legitimacy or authority, which is the fact that he was punished by the government for trying to call attention to the fact that there was this virus going around.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDo you think that the people in China view the government’s response as an attempt to protect them from the virus or to protect the government from the story of a situation that’s out of control?\n\namy qin\n\nBoth. People really believe that the government wants to get this epidemic under control. But at the same time, they know that the government is only going to do this in a way that does not threaten its own hold on power. And that means taking control of the narrative — sending in their own journalists to make sure that only the positive aspects of what they’re doing is being highlighted, and that people who are slipping through the cracks or all the failures of the policy are not being highlighted.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAmy, I’m curious. Have you been able to speak to the Zhang family since you evacuated, since you took that flight from Wuhan to California?\n\namy qin\n\nWe have. The last time we checked in with them, their situation had changed. The mother and the daughter were both infected with the coronavirus and have finally been able to get into one of the makeshift quarantine centers set up by the government. Bella, the daughter, sent us a video of the center, and it just shows a huge exhibition center with beds crowded tightly together and all these sick patients in these beds. Meanwhile, Bella’s brother and their grandmother are still at home back in the family apartment sick and unable to get into a hospital. The grandmother is in very serious condition. She can barely get out of bed. And they’re also still living with their father, who is the only family member who hasn’t gotten infected so fae. Though they all think that it will be a matter of time.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo basically, half the family is being cared for and the other half have been kind of abandoned.\n\namy qin\n\nRight. And remember, their grandfather had died in their family apartment and was taken to be cremated immediately. And they still don’t even know where his ashes are.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIs the reality that another death in the family could happen something that they are preparing for?\n\namy qin\n\nYes, they’ve been planning for it. They told us that when the grandmother dies, they’re not going to let her go to the crematorium. But actually, the mother said she’s going to drag her body to the local neighborhood committee and just put it there on the front steps to show them how their inaction has devastated their entire family.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDo you know whether the family knows about Dr. Li’s death, or if they were able to watch that video of Xi Jinping in public addressing the situation?\n\namy qin\n\nI think if they’ve seen, it’s barely registered. They are so consumed with just trying to survive right now, like so many other people in Wuhan, that they’re just putting their heads down trying to move forward.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAmy, thank you very much.\n\namy qin\n\nThanks, Michael.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Thursday, nearly 15,000 new cases of coronavirus were added to the tally of infected people in the Chinese province where Wuhan is located — the largest one-day increase of the epidemic so far. That brings the total number of cases to more than 48,000. At the same time, 242 new deaths were also reported, bringing the total death toll in the province to 1,310. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. For the second day in a row, President Trump intervened in the prosecution of his longtime friend and adviser, Roger Stone, this time by attacking the judge in the case. On Tuesday, at the president’s urging, the Department of Justice recommended a more lenient prison sentence for Stone, who was convicted of obstructing a congressional investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. That move prompted four federal prosecutors to leave the case in protest. On Wednesday, Trump claimed without evidence in a tweet that the judge who will sentence Stone is biased against the president in what Democratic lawmakers said was a clear attempt to intimidate the judge before she sentences Stone.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) The president ran against the swamp in Washington, a place where the game is rigged by the powerful to benefit them personally. I ask my fellow Americans, what is more swampy, what is more fetid, what is more stinking than the most powerful person in the country literally changing the rules to benefit a crony guilty of breaking the law?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn response, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer called for an investigation into Trump’s conduct.\n\narchived recording (chuck schumer) As a result, I have formally requested that the inspector general of the Justice Department investigate this matter immediately.\n\nmichael barbaro",

    "article_text": "“We’re going to put out an executive order today. New York State on pause — only essential businesses will be functioning. 100% of the workforce must stay home. This is the most drastic action we can take.” “Everything is uncharted territory. Nobody knows what’s going to happen in the news any minute.” “I think I’ve been asking a lot of how we could have prevented this.” “Am I going to see another depression like my grandfather saw in the 1920s?” “Over the past few days, New York City has taken a lot of important measures. I’m just worried it came a little bit too late.” “I think I’m scared of having to see more death and from reading stories from abroad, having to make decisions about resources. And I’m worried people in my life are going to die from it. A few days ago, I had to watch a patient basically slowly die. I just felt helpless. This is the first time I’ve really seen people that I truly don’t know how to help. And they are coming in so sick that everything I’m used to doing to be able to treat them, I can’t really do.” “How was your day off, Mich?” “It was emotional, to say the least.” “Why?” “It’s just, like, the hospital has been insane. And every hour, like, things are changing. So it’s just, like, trying to keep up with that while trying to read about what I should be treating these people with, while people are rolling in the worst — I don’t know. They say in 18 days it’s supposed to get really bad. I guarantee you tomorrow we’re going to have like 1,000 more. The numbers are going to go up.” “That’s no problem at all. Thank you very much. That’s very nice. Thank you. Sounds good. See you then. Bye. Well, I have been working. A lot of people are not, which is hard. This place used to have 30 employees, and on Sunday we let go of 90% of the staff. We want to reopen so we can rehire people, you know? It was really hard to let everyone go. These are people that are at the level, they’re not wealthy, you know? This is a very harsh reality. And actually what the job is, is smiling through stress. And this is hard to smile through.” [Rain falling] “It’s go time here at the community kitchen. This is the time where we have to ramp up our services to be very sensitive to how people are feeling. People are coming to us feeling vulnerable. They maybe work in the restaurant industry. People who work in Broadway and in a lot of the behind-the-scenes, they’re coming here saying, well, I don’t have work. So those industries are the folks that are the first ones that we’re seeing come through. But we’re preparing to see more people come through in need.” “All programming at the senior center is suspended for the next two weeks. Stay safe and have a good day.” “So this is not business as usual. We don’t know what’s coming up if people have to stay in their homes for a longer period of time. And we want to make sure people are getting food, especially since a lot of industries are out of work. We are expecting a lot of new people, and we are going to be ready to receive them. This is all very new for them, and some of them are feeling guilt or shame coming to an emergency food program. So we have to remember that we do this all the time, but for them, it’s something new and something that they feel anxious about doing. We’re just getting them registered. They’re getting food. That’s our main priority is people are getting food.” [Sighing with exasperation] “I’m not supposed to touch my face. Hold on a second.” “I have prepared myself already, mentally, multiple times, to go back to Oregon and leave this entire beautiful dream behind me. So many people, including many of my friends, are working at bars, at restaurants, which are now closed. And now we’re all at home, wondering, Can we make it another month? Can our families afford to pay their mortgages at home? Do we just need to go back and start working, just so we can help our own families, the people that we love the most, stay in the homes that we grew up in? It’s hard to think that my mom or my dad are never going to see retirement. The best things that we can do right now as a community is just to give ourselves over to something that brings us true happiness. Because right now, it feels like it’s about to get very desperate.” “This is only something that we can get through if we’re working together. There will be so much suffering, unnecessary suffering, if we’re not really looking out for each other and if we only think about ourselves and our well-being. We have to be thinking about each other.” [Birds chirping]",

    "article_text": "michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”\n\n[music]\n\nToday: A suburb north of New York City has become one of the largest clusters of the coronavirus in the U.S. My colleague, Sarah Maslin Nir, went there. It’s Thursday, March 19.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSarah, tell us about the past few weeks in this town of New Rochelle, New York.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIt began with a local man. His name is Larry Garbuz. He’s a lawyer. He’s about 50, lives in New Rochelle, which is this suburb about five or so miles north of New York City’s border. And he falls ill about February 27, and he starts to decline pretty rapidly. He asks a neighbor to drive him to the hospital and spends several days there really spiraling. Then on March 2, they find out what was wrong with Larry Garbuz, and it was coronavirus.\n\n[music]\n\narchived recording Cases of coronavirus are growing nationwide, and New York state is no exception.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nHe’s the first person in this suburb that is diagnosed.\n\narchived recording Investigators scrambling to retrace the patient’s movements from the Bronxville hospital where he was first treated.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd disease investigators then have to trace his movements.\n\narchived recording The week before he knew he was contagious, the married father of four traveled around the New York City area. He also attended temple services back in Westchester.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd found out that he had attended religious services, just as anyone would — a wedding, a bar mitzvah — about a week before.\n\narchived recording Synagogue Young Israel of New Rochelle ordered to close, and hundreds of people who attended services there have been told to quarantine themselves at home.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd the Westchester County Health Department ordered a hundred families, congregants at that synagogue, to self-quarantine.\n\n[music]\n\nSo I’m sitting in our offices at Times Square when we hear about this diagnosis, and I immediately get in my car and head up to New Rochelle. Because this is going to have huge ripple effects in his town. We know it. And when I arrived, people didn’t even know it had happened. There was a man pushing at the door of Young Israel, Mr. Garbuz’s synagogue, trying to get in for evening prayers, not understanding why it was locked. There were restaurants, where people should be turning up for evening hours, not understanding why their customers were calling in takeout instead. This was a town where the news that they were part of this global pandemic was just settling in.\n\nspeaker But there’s nothing we can do about it. I think it’s another flu that’s going to go away, hopefully. sarah maslin nir Mm-hmm.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nPeople were barely understanding that this had happened to them.\n\nspeaker And I’m still going to go out. I’m going to go to CVS, the post office, the bank, because — I’m going to wash my hands. I’m going to try never to ever touch my face. I’m going to live my life.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo to the degree that something is happening here in New Rochelle, it’s dawning on people very slowly.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI think it’s dawning on America very slowly, and New Rochelle was a reflection of the lack of seriousness with which the country was taking this threat.\n\n[music]\n\nBut from that quiet first evening in New Rochelle, things rapidly began to change.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) Good afternoon. New Rochelle is a particular problem.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd on March 10, something unprecedented happens.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) What we are going to do is focus on an area, a concentric circle around —\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nA one-mile radius containment zone is designated in New Rochelle, surrounding the neighborhood of this first patient.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) Facilities within that area, schools within that area would be closed for two weeks. We’ll go in, we’ll clean the schools and assess the situation. This can’t be a political decision. This is a public health decision.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nThat containment zone is the red hot center of New York’s coronavirus outbreak.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) We’re also going to use the National Guard in the containment area.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd then, in comes the National Guard.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) It is a dramatic action, but it is the largest cluster in the country. And this is literally a matter of life and death. That’s not an overly rhetorical statement.\n\n[music]\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nYou have people holed up in their homes, people needing testing, needing health care, needing the basic necessities of life and affected by this virus that dramatically curtails their movements. I wanted to understand, how is the government keeping us safe? How are the health care workers carrying out testing? And how are the people of New Rochelle coping?\n\nsarah maslin nir I’m standing on Lincoln Avenue, which is just outside the containment zone in New Rochelle, where a huge truck full of hundreds and thousands of pounds of food has just arrived. About six uniformed members of the National Guard are standing outside this truck as a pallet is unloaded full of —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Sarah, why exactly is the National Guard there? What is their official mission? When I think the National Guard being dispatched, it’s usually after a natural disaster and they are literally there to pick up the pieces.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nYeah. These men and women had been to floods. They’d been to earthquakes. They’d been to hurricane zones. This is the first-ever time they were called to an epidemic event.\n\nmember of the national guard So we’re basically responding to all natural disasters in New York state —\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd they were called here for two main purposes, which is to deliver meals to people bound in their homes by quarantine, and to clean.\n\nsarah maslin nir So I’ve just walked into the Jewish Community Center on Wilmot Road in Scarsdale. Inside, 60 members of the National Guard are doing a deep clean.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI watched them clean at a community center, and the meticulousness was really incredible.\n\nmember of the national guard I’m currently going to inform the process of sanitizing the equipment. First, you have to take the equipment and put it into the solution of water and bleach.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI walk into a classroom for children, and there are these men and women squeezed in their military gear into teeny, tiny plastic seats for toddlers, poring over piles of building blocks and Legos and scrubbing each block by hand.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe National Guard is scrubbing children’s toys?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nYeah, it was an uncanny sight. They did this kind of thing throughout the containment zone — cleaning synagogues, city facilities, community centers, scrubbing ceilings, floors, chairs, anything that a sick person may have touched.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, Sarah, as you’re describing this, the National Guard is on the ground. Local officials are still theoretically in charge. Right? Like the people who run the city, probably even the county. So is it clear to you who is in charge, and is this all coordinated?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIn the early moments of New Rochelle coming to terms with this new reality, it was a lot of moving pieces. It was a city in turmoil with no real leadership structure in place at that moment. But I get in my car, and I drive down to downtown New Rochelle to the headquarters of the Westchester County Health Department and discover that something had been building here all along.\n\nsarah maslin nir I’m standing inside of the incident response center in New Rochelle, and there’s a group of about 30 nurses on folding chairs getting a briefing about their deployment to test people who are quarantined at home. speaker Make sure go to the bathroom. Wash your hands properly before you do anything. Take breaks. You don’t have to rush around. We want to make sure that you are taking care of each other and —\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd there I come upon a huge, bustling incident command center.\n\nsarah maslin nir They’re going out in groups of three, in protective gear with swab kits.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is there. The room is filled with nurses. There is an assembly line of test gear, and test kits, and what’s called P.P.E. — personal protective equipment. People are filing around the room equipping themselves to get ready to deploy to the houses of sick people to test them for coronavirus.\n\nsarah maslin nir And they’re all asking lots of very understandable questions. nurse Is there going to be an influx of testing, or it’s just, like, we’re only doing New Rochelle? sarah maslin nir How do we make sure these people feel safe? How do we make sure that we’re safe as we go out onto the front lines?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nSo at this point, in the United States only 25,000 people had been tested for coronavirus. And this command center is to send that number way up. So people will call into their doctors, tell their symptoms. They’ll get put on a list. And every so often, these groups of nurses were getting an address, information. They’d put on head-to-toe protective gear and head out to sample and test those people. And there are big signs that say, “We’ve got this.”\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe signs actually say, “We’ve got this?”\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nHandwritten signs all over the room.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what are you thinking when you see this?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI think I’ve finally found the coordinated response that this situation seems to call for.\n\n[music]\n\nThis is a room full of all the layers of government, from the state, to different agencies, to health care workers in their scrubs, coordinating to take on this crisis head-on. And after nearly a week of frightened townspeople and scared kids, this is exactly what you wanted to see. It was a relief.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Sarah, what happens next?\n\narchived recording What else can you tell us about this containment plan? archived recording (andrew cuomo) Think of it this way. We have 173 cases in the entire state. Right? We have 108 in New Rochelle.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAt this point, things are starting to get up and running in New Rochelle. We’re about two weeks out from the first diagnosis, and the National Guard is here. There is the incident command center. And that command center is sending people out to do in-home testing.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) — do what we have to do. But you know, Jake, this is a microcosm of what we’re going to be looking at. The numbers are going to go up consistently, because our testing is way behind the reality of what the situation is.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nBut still, it’s not enough. The numbers of people tested at this point are only in the hundreds.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) China was doing 10,000 tests per day. This country, in total we’ve done about 5,000 tests. So we really have to get that testing capacity up if we’re going to make the difference.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nNew York state recognizes even what they’re doing there in New Rochelle, it’s not enough. We have to ramp up testing.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so how do they actually do that?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nActually, they saw what was happening in South Korea, where they’ve created these highly effective drive-through testing centers, managing to churn out 275,000 since diagnosis. And that happened, actually, around the same time that our country had its first case. So New York state decides we need these centers. And so I went to see this myself.\n\nsarah maslin nir So I’m recording this now standing outside the mobile drive-through testing center in a public park called Glen Island in Rochester.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nWhen you get to this beautiful island park, there’s seagulls wheeling overhead. There’s the Long Island Sound glinting. You arrive at what looks like three beautiful wedding tents. They’re tents that could be for any garden party. And you only realize what this is because of the cop who stops you at the drawbridge to this island with his megaphone blaring.\n\ncop Are you here for testing? Yes? OK. Keep your windows rolled up at all times. Have your ID ready. Windows rolled up at all times, windows closed at all times. Have your ID ready. You’re going over the drawbridge, and stay to the right. sarah maslin nir Thank you for helping us. chuck hamilton Sure.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nMy guide was a gentleman by the name of Chuck Hamilton. He was in charge of operations at that site.\n\nchuck hamilton There is three tents with six lanes. We’re being directed by our National Guard personnel right now.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd as we pulled up, you head down a meandering lane lined with orange cones and members of the National Guard and other police forces.\n\nchuck hamilton — will advise us to keep our windows closed at this particular point.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nThey demanded I put my ID on the windshield.\n\nchuck hamilton Windows closed up. sarah maslin nir Sir? government official Put your IDs up on the dash. chuck hamilton OK. All identification must now be put on the dash.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nThey don’t want you to open your window, hand them anything. So groups of people in Tyvek aprons, those respirator masks, lean over, peer through your windshield, tap your name and info into a tablet, and make sure you’re confirmed for your appointment at the drive-through testing center.\n\nchuck hamilton — stage two. sarah maslin nir And there are two silver — chuck hamilton These people are in full Tyvek hooded suits.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nNext, you’re waved from this first zone where they check you in, called a cold zone because there isn’t a risk of contamination there, to the hot zone.\n\nsarah maslin nir — full body suits? chuck hamilton Yes, these are all registered nurses, paramedics, or E.M.T.s. She’s indicating when you’re — you keep the window closed.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIn the hot zone, I was approached by two nurses in full, what looked to me like hazmat suits, eye shields, heads covered, every seal wrapped up tightly to make sure nothing could get through. I rolled down my window.\n\nnurse This is section two. So there’s section one, intake —\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd they told me what they would do if I were in fact sick, which was tip my head back, thread a swab into my nostril and then another into the back of my throat with a tongue depressor, put those swabs in vials, and send those off to the lab.\n\nnurse I’d tell you to lean forward and tilt your head a little bit backwards, take a deep breath. I’m going to put the swab in. And that’s it. The other swab is the backup control.\n\n[music]\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI rolled up my window tightly and then moved on to the next station, where I was processed. And a woman held up a little handwritten sign that said, “Feel better.” I imagine that everybody else going through that line needed that sign real bad.\n\nsarah maslin nir So you’re in total protective gear. You’re doing this work. You’re on the front of the front of the front line. How do you feel?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI spoke to one nurse who was in that hazmat suit in the hot zone. And she appeared to me to be the age demographic that is at risk from coronavirus, which is 50-plus. And yet she felt this was the moment to step up.\n\nlisa I feel compelled to help, compelled to help. And you know, we have to be careful. One mistake could be a big problem, obviously. We can become contaminated. But this is the time — this is why we became nurses. This is the time to help. If we don’t do this, what do we do? sarah maslin nir What’s your name? lisa My name is Lisa —\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIf I’m not here, what am I doing?\n\nsarah maslin nir Can you spell the last name? lisa B, A, E, Z. And then hyphen —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo has this testing site been effective? Is it making a difference in containing and combating the virus?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIt is making a difference in figuring out who has this illness — and a tremendous difference. They have hustled, since it opened on Friday, 2,849 people through that drive-through as of our conversation, Michael. This is charging ahead and vastly increasing New York’s capacity to test these people. This is how we’re going to get a handle on this disease. To understand how it spreads, who’s affected by it, to model it forward, to know what we’re up against.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. You really can’t stop it until you can measure it.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nExactly. And you can’t protect people unless you know who’s got it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Sarah, at this point, the system that you have described to handle this acute crisis in New Rochelle is containment zone, the National Guard to keep it contained, but more importantly, keep people safe, clean, fed. And now there’s this mobile testing center nearby trying to figure out just how widely the virus has spread. Overall, is this starting to feel like a model for other places?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nMore than just feel like a model, it is the model for New York state’s response. In the coming week and weeks, more of exactly what’s happening in New Rochelle is going to be set up all over the state. Nassau County, Jones Beach, which isn’t too far, just got its first mobile testing center modeled off this. It’s coming to Staten Island in New York City, to Rockland County, another place not far away.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI met a man while I was out there in New Rochelle. We were standing outside a classroom where National Guard were scrubbing Legos. And he said to me, you know, they talk about reinventing the wheel, but this is inventing the wheel. And when we look back at how to handle these things in the future, people are going to look back and say, how did they do it in New Rochelle? And he might be right. The whole country might end up looking at this as a model, because the whole country might be in New Rochelle’s position soon. And this may be just what they have to go on.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd do you get the sense that what’s happening in New Rochelle — this invention of the wheel when it comes to how to deal with a pandemic in the United States — do you get the sense that it’s working and that this is basically all on the right track?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIt’s hard to know. Every day there are new cases. I don’t think we’ll know for a while what’s working. But it’s deeply comforting when you look out across the nation and the world and see this patchwork of responses that barely hang together, to know that here in this state, in this city, in New Rochelle, a herculean effort is being made to get this thing right and keep people safe.\n\nsarah maslin nir I am walking down North Avenue in New Rochelle. It’s the same block where the synagogue at the heart of this outbreak, Young Israel of New Rochelle sits closed at the other end of the street. And walking —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, Sarah, we have been talking about how this town has been totally transformed in what’s really just a matter of days, a couple weeks. A lot of outsiders coming in — National Guard, volunteers parachuting in to help. But what about the community itself? The people who are there in the city, in this containment zone, how are they handling this?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nMichael, this is a hard time to be anyone, in or out of the zone. And we are all looking for a dose of human goodness.\n\nsarah maslin nir And we were just talking outside. It’s a little intimidating, huh? A little scary? speaker 1 Mm-hmm. sarah maslin nir How do you feel about it? speaker 1 Sad. sarah maslin nir Why? speaker 1 Because people’s dying. sarah maslin nir But I want you to know that that’s just a very few older people. And I don’t want you to feel scared. Do you — speaker 1 I’m not scared. sarah maslin nir You’re not?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIf you go to New Rochelle and you see people asked unimaginable things, asked to cut themselves off from everyone they love to protect everyone else, you see people willingly doing it.\n\nsarah maslin nir How are you holding up? speaker 2 We’ve been doing a lot of deliveries. As you can see, there’s no one in the restaurant right now except you and I and some staff.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nPeople, as much as they’ve been put upon and wish it were otherwise, they are resolute and resilient. And they’re accepting this because they know it’s for a greater purpose.\n\nspeaker 2 We just want to make sure that the stress level and the anguish that the public might be feeling, that they feel that everything that can be done is being done for their health. sarah maslin nir Are you helping out too? speaker 1 Yeah. sarah maslin nir Are you going to pack any bags or give any bags to any of the families? speaker 1 Mm-hmm.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nFrom the delivery people who’ve worked out systems to leave bags of food on a staircase and run away with a wave, to the sick people indoors waiting for that meal —\n\nspeaker 3 What we’ve been doing, as I’ve coined the phrase, the drop and dash. So you literally pull up to the house, you drop the bag off, and you run like the wind. And that’s it.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nEverybody gets it. Everybody just wants everyone else to get better.\n\nspeaker 3 — feel like someone cares about them. Yes, they’re quarantined. It’s a terrible thing. And when I pick up the phone, and I see a name that I recognize, I speak to them. I say, how are you holding up? And they ask me the same thing. How are you holding up? And we both crack a joke and we laugh and that’s it. You got to keep a sense of humor with this whole thing. And it’s terrible for everyone. It really — my heart is aching for them, and they feel the same way about me.\n\n[music]\n\nspeaker 3 This whole thing is just bringing everyone together, hopefully not literally because that’s how corona spreads. sarah maslin nir You got to laugh, huh? speaker 3 Yeah. You got to laugh. sarah maslin nir It’s the only way to get through it. speaker 3 100 percent. sarah maslin nir Are you going to go out on another delivery now? speaker 3 Um, I don’t have anything at the moment.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHere’s what else you need to know today. On Wednesday, the United States and Canada said they would close their shared border to all but essential travel, becoming the latest countries to restrict border crossings to slow the spread of the pandemic.\n\narchived recording (justin trudeau) In both our countries, we’re encouraging people to stay home. We’re telling our citizens not to visit their neighbors if they don’t absolutely have to. Well, this collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMeanwhile in Washington, the Senate approved a relief package already passed by the House, that provides sick leave, unemployment benefits, free coronavirus testing, and food and medical aid to Americans affected by the pandemic. President Trump quickly signed the legislation into law, the first of several congressional bills related to the coronavirus that he is expected to support.\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) The Congress has an enormous role to play in responding to this challenge, and we are determined to do that duty.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn a speech from the Senate floor, Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell called for a bipartisan approach to the crisis.\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) This is not a challenge anyone wanted for our nation, but it is a challenge we will overcome. Someday, hopefully soon, our nation will have this virus on its heels.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.\n\n[music]",

Gallinari recalled a lengthy wait for details and the uncommon instructions issued to Thunder players: You can shower, but you can’t leave.\n\n“We couldn’t really understand what was going on,” Gallinari said in an interview on Sunday. “We were all shocked. Maybe I was a little less shocked than anybody else knowing what’s going in on my country.”\n\nThe N.B.A. on Wednesday became the first major professional sports league in North America to suspend operations in response to the coronavirus outbreak, now a pandemic, but Gallinari, as Italy’s pre-eminent basketball export, had been consumed by the crisis for weeks. Only China, where the respiratory virus originated, has been hit harder by the outbreak than Italy, which as of Sunday had reported nearly 25,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 1,800 deaths so far.",

    "headline": "Two Women Fell Sick From the Coronavirus. One Survived.",
    "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/13/world/asia/coronavirus-death-life.html",
    "article_text": "The young mothers didn’t tell their children they had the coronavirus. Mama was working hard, they said, to save sick people. Instead, Deng Danjing and Xia Sisi were fighting for their lives in the same hospitals where they worked, weak from fever and gasping for breath. Within a matter of weeks, they had gone from healthy medical professionals on the front lines of the epidemic in Wuhan, China, to coronavirus patients in critical condition. The world is still struggling to fully understand the new virus, its symptoms, spread and sources. For some, it can feel like a common cold. For others, it is a deadly infection that ravages the lungs and pushes the immune system into overdrive, destroying even healthy cells. The difference between life and death can depend on the patient’s health, age and access to care — although not always. The virus has infected more than 132,000 globally. The vast majority of cases have been mild, with limited symptoms. But the virus’s progression can be quick, at which point the chances of survival plummet. Around 68,000 people have recovered, while nearly 5,000 have died. The fates of Ms. Deng and Dr. Xia reflect the unpredictable nature of a virus that affects everyone differently, at times defying statistical averages and scientific research. As the new year opened in China, the women were leading remarkably similar lives. Both were 29 years old. Both were married, each with a young child on whom she doted. Ms. Deng, a nurse, had worked for three years at Wuhan No. 7 Hospital, in the city where she grew up and where the coronavirus pandemic began. Her mother was a nurse there, too, and in their free time they watched movies or shopped together. Ms. Deng’s favorite activity was playing with her two pet kittens, Fat Tiger and Little White, the second of which she had rescued just three months before falling sick. Before the epidemic, Ms. Deng had promised to take her 5-year-old daughter to the aquarium. Dr. Xia, a gastroenterologist, also came from a family of medical professionals. As a young child, she had accompanied her mother, a nurse, to work. She joined the Union Jiangbei Hospital of Wuhan in 2015 and was the youngest doctor in her department. Her colleagues called her “Little Sisi” or “Little Sweetie” because she always had a smile for them. She loved Sichuan hot pot, a dish famous for its numbingly spicy broth. Dr. Xia loved traveling with her family. She had recently visited Wuzhizhou Island, a resort destination off the southern coast of China. When a mysterious new virus struck the city, the women began working long hours, treating a seemingly endless flood of patients. They took precautions to protect themselves. But they succumbed to the infection, the highly contagious virus burrowing deep into their lungs, causing fever and pneumonia. In the hospital, each took a turn for the worse. One recovered. One did not.\n\nSymptoms Onset of virus & hospitalization Ms. Deng, a Wuhan native who liked makeup and hanging out with her friends at Starbucks, had worked for eight years as a nurse, following her mother’s career path. Dr. Xia, who was a favorite among elderly patients, spent long hours at the hospital helping to treat people suspected of having the virus. The symptoms came on suddenly. Dr. Xia had ended her night shift on Jan. 14 when she was called back to attend to a patient — a 76-year-old man with suspected coronavirus. She dropped in frequently to check in on him. Five days later, she started feeling unwell. Exhausted, she took a two-hour nap at home, then checked her temperature: It was 102 degrees. Her chest felt tight. A few weeks later, in early February, Ms. Deng, the nurse, was preparing to eat dinner at the hospital office, when the sight of food left her nauseated. She brushed the feeling aside, figuring she was worn out by work. She had spent the beginning of the outbreak visiting the families of confirmed patients and teaching them to disinfect their homes. After forcing down some food, Ms. Deng went home to shower, and then, feeling groggy, took a nap. When she woke up, her temperature was 100 degrees. Fever is the most common symptom of the coronavirus, seen in nearly 90 percent of patients. About a fifth of people experience shortness of breath, often including a cough and congestion. Many also feel fatigued. Both women rushed to see doctors. Chest scans showed damage to their lungs, a tell-tale sign of the coronavirus that is present in at least 85 percent of patients, according to one study. In particular, Ms. Deng’s CT scan showed what the doctor called ground-glass opacities on her lower right lung — hazy spots that indicated fluid or inflammation around her airways. The hospital had no space, so Ms. Deng checked into a hotel to avoid infecting her husband and 5-year-old daughter. She sweated through the night. At one point, her calf twitched. In the morning, she was admitted to the hospital. Her throat was swabbed for a genetic test, which confirmed she had the coronavirus. Her room in a newly opened staff ward was small, with two cots and a number assigned to each one. Ms. Deng was in bed 28. Her roommate was a colleague who had also been diagnosed with the virus. At Jiangbei Hospital, 18 miles away, Dr. Xia was struggling to breathe. She was placed in an isolation ward, treated by doctors and nurses who wore protective suits and safety goggles. The room was cold.\n\nTreatment Day 1, hospitalization begins After Ms. Deng was admitted to the hospital, she told her husband to take care of himself, reminding him of the 14-day incubation period for the virus. He assured her his temperature was normal. Dr. Xia asked her husband about the possibility of getting off oxygen therapy soon. He responded optimistically. When Ms. Deng checked into the hospital, she tried to stay upbeat. She texted her husband, urging him to wear a mask even at home, and to clean all their bowls and chopsticks with boiling water or throw them out. Her husband sent a photograph of one of their cats at home. “Waiting for you to come back,” he said. “I think it’ll take 10 days, half a month,” she replied. “Take care of yourself.” There is no known cure for Covid-19, the official name for the disease caused by the new coronavirus. So doctors rely on a cocktail of other medicines, mostly antiviral drugs, to alleviate the symptoms. Ms. Deng’s doctor prescribed a regimen of arbidol, an antiviral medicine used to treat the flu in Russia and China; Tamiflu, another flu medicine more popular internationally; and Kaletra, an HIV medicine thought to block the replication of the virus. Ms. Deng was taking at least 12 pills a day, as well as traditional Chinese medicine. Arbidol, an antiviral medication, was prescribed to help alleviate Ms. Deng’s symptoms. Despite her optimism, she grew weaker. Her mother delivered home-cooked food outside the ward, but she had no appetite. To feed her, a nurse had to come at 8:30 each morning to hook her up to an intravenous drip with nutrients. Another drip pumped antibodies into her bloodstream, and still another antiviral medicine. Dr. Xia, too, was severely ill, but appeared to be slowly fighting the infection. Her fever had subsided after a few days, and she began to breathe more easily after being attached to a ventilator. Her spirits lifted. On Jan. 25, she told her colleagues she was recovering. “💪💪💪💪💪💪 I will return to the team soon,” she texted them on WeChat. “We need you the most,” one of her colleagues responded. In early February, Dr. Xia asked her husband, Wu Shilei, also a doctor, whether he thought she could get off oxygen therapy soon. “Take it easy. Don’t be too anxious,” he replied on WeChat. He told her that the ventilator could possibly be removed by the following week. “I keep on thinking about getting better soon,” Dr. Xia responded. There was reason to believe she was on the mend. After all, most coronavirus patients recover. Later, Dr. Xia tested negative twice for the coronavirus. She told her mother she expected to be discharged on Feb. 8.\n\nDecline Day 4 to 16 after hospitalization In the hospital, Ms. Deng’s only contacts were her roommate and the medical staff. She added a caption to a photo with her doctor, saying laughter would help chase the illness away. Two tests indicated that Dr. Xia was free of the virus, but her condition suddenly deteriorated. By Ms. Deng’s fourth day in the hospital, she could no longer pretend to be cheerful. She was vomiting, having diarrhea and relentlessly shivering. Her fever jumped to 101.3 degrees. Early in the morning on Feb. 5, she woke from a fitful sleep to find the medicine had done nothing to lower her temperature. She cried. She said she was classified as critically ill. The next day, she threw up three times, until she was left spitting white bubbles. She felt she was hallucinating. She could not smell or taste, and her heart rate slowed to about 50 beats per minute. On a phone call, Ms. Deng’s mother tried to reassure her that she was young and otherwise healthy, and that the virus would pass like a bad cold. But Ms. Deng feared otherwise. “I felt like I was walking on the edge of death,” she wrote in a social media post from her hospital bed the next day. China defines a critically ill patient as someone with respiratory failure, shock or organ failure. Around 5 percent of infected patients became critical in China, according to one of the largest studies to date of coronavirus cases. Of those, 49 percent died. (Those rates may eventually change once more cases are examined around the world.) While Dr. Xia appeared to be recovering, she was still terrified of dying. Testing can be faulty, and negative results don’t necessarily mean patients are in the clear. She asked her mother for a promise: Could her parents look after her 2-year-old son if she didn’t make it? Hoping to dispel her anxiety with humor, her mother, Jiang Wenyan, chided her: “He’s your own son. Don’t you want to raise him yourself?” Dr. Xia also worried about her husband. Over video chat, she urged him to put on protective equipment at the hospital where he worked. “She said she would wait for me to return safely,” he said, “and go to the frontline again with me when she recovered.” Then came the call. Dr. Xia’s condition had suddenly deteriorated. In the early hours of Feb. 7, her husband rushed to the emergency room. Her heart had stopped.\n\nRecovery Day 17 after hospitalization After being discharged, Ms. Deng briefly got to see her mother, who had been working at the hospital during her illness. She then went home to isolate herself for two weeks. In most cases, the body repairs itself. The immune system produces enough antibodies to clear the virus, and the patient recovers. By the end of Ms. Deng’s first week in the hospital, her fever had receded. She could eat the food her mother delivered. On Feb. 10, as her appetite returned, she looked up photos of meat skewers online and posted them wishfully to social media. On Feb. 15, her throat swab came back negative for the virus. Three days later, she tested negative again. She could go home. Ms. Deng met her mother briefly at the hospital’s entrance. Then, because Wuhan remained locked down, without taxis or public transportation, she walked home alone. “I felt like a little bird,” she recalled. “My freedom had been returned to me.” She had to isolate at home for 14 days. Her husband and daughter stayed with her parents. At home, she threw out her clothing, which she had been wearing for her entire time in the hospital. Since then, she has passed the time by playing with her cats and watching television. She jokes that she is getting an early taste of retirement. She does daily deep breathing exercises to strengthen her lungs, and her cough has faded. The Chinese government has urged recovered patients to donate plasma, which experts say contains antibodies that could be used to treat the sick. Ms. Deng contacted a local blood bank soon after getting home. She plans to go back to work as soon as the hospital allows it. “It was the nation that saved me,” she said. “And I think I can pay it back to the nation.”",

A sense of crisis pervades the home as employees wear masks, constantly wash their hands and disinfect every surface, said its deputy director, Kumi Iwasaki.\n\nIt’s a life-or-death mission: The virus kills older people at a far higher rate. The battle is being waged all across Japan, which has the highest proportion of elderly people in the world, as the number of reported cases in the country has steadily climbed to 230, with 11 deaths, mostly among people in their 80s. Globally, nearly 3,000 people have died, the vast majority in China.\n\nOther countries with aging populations, like South Korea and Italy, which have both experienced recent surges in infections, are also facing acute challenges. Those two countries have done just what experts recommend: They have moved quickly to test large numbers of people so they can be treated and isolated from others.\n\nBut after weeks of caution, the Japanese government has only just begun to take more aggressive action, most notably by moving to close schools for a month. That step, though, was aimed at the young, who often show only mild symptoms or none at all when infected, not vulnerable older people, who sometimes develop severe pneumonia.",

    "article_text": "What may seem like prophecy is actually the fruit of research. As a writer, I’ve always been more surprised by reality than by imagination, so I try to hew to science, history and human experience. In both “The Siege” and “The End of October,” I examined what had happened in similar episodes in the past. I spoke to experts who could guide me to create a plausible narrative — from facts that would resonate with the fiction on the screen and on the page.\n\nPandemics — like wars and economic depressions, with which they often coincide — leave scars on the body of history. So much of the story of civilization has been about our struggle to survive in close quarters with one another, which allows pathogens to proliferate. As some of the most fearsome communicable diseases of the past — polio, typhus, cholera, yellow fever — have been tamed or eliminated, they have receded from the awful prominence they once held in human affairs. Plague killed perhaps 50 million people during the reign of the Emperor Justinian in the sixth century, about half the world’s population at the time. The next plague pandemic, known as the Black Death, was the deadliest in human history, arising in China in 1334 and stalking the trade routes of Central Asia and Europe until it subsided 200 years later. Smallpox, one of the most infectious diseases on record, killed about 400,000 people a year in Europe alone, and of the survivors, about a third became blind.\n\nThe scourge didn’t abate until 1796, when an English doctor named Edward Jenner realized that milkmaids seemed immune to the disease. He theorized that they had been protected by their exposure to cowpox, a similar disease found in cattle but not fatal in humans. To test his theory, he took a sample of cowpox from a farm girl named Sarah Nelmes and injected it into his gardener’s 9-year-old son. Months later, Jenner injected the boy with smallpox as well. When the boy failed to become infected, a new age in medicine was born.\n\nAs I researched my novel, I realized how close we had come in recent times to facing an existential disease threat. One of the heroes of public health was Carlo Urbani, an Italian doctor who specialized in parasitic illnesses. He devoted himself to fighting flatworms in children living along the Mekong River. In February 2003, he received a call from the French hospital in Hanoi. A dangerously ill patient had arrived from Hong Kong. Antibiotics were ineffective. Doctors and nurses in the hospital were falling ill. (Altogether the man infected 80 people, including more than half the medical workers who cared for him.)\n\nDr. Urbani imposed a quarantine on the hospital. He was the first to identify what came to be called severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, notifying the World Health Organization of a highly infectious novel disease that could easily become pandemic. He personally ferried blood samples on his moped through the panicked city to a lab. He persuaded the Vietnamese government to address the contagion transparently and decisively. Thanks to his actions, Hanoi was spared the worst, the disease’s spread was curbed in 16 other countries and SARS was contained within 100 days. This was hailed as the most effective response to a potential pandemic in history, but the triumph was shadowed by Urbani’s own death of SARS a month after the outbreak began.",

    "article_text": "SEATTLE — There is a strange in-betweenness to life in the nation’s coronavirus capital. Classes continue on the University of Washington’s campus, some half-empty, others completely full. I have been teaching here 13 years, and faculty members have been getting detailed, palpably anxious instructions from administrators on how to teach online and on hand-washing and social distance, and reminders that no one on our 46,000-student campus has tested positive for the coronavirus that causes Covid-19. For now.\n\nThe local schools my children attend were deep-cleaned last weekend, and they were still open on Thursday. Rumors fly through middle-schoolers’ text strings, neighborhood message boards, conversations in the grocery line. We’re all at the store daily, stocking up on canned goods and paper towels, awaiting news of school closings and home quarantines. Costco is overrun. A friend told me about a beleaguered Costco employee who had to stand in a corner of the store yelling, “No toilet paper!” over and over, and redirecting shoppers from the empty pallets.\n\nOf course, the dangers here are much greater than running out of toilet paper. Sixty-nine people have already been found to have the novel coronavirus in the Seattle area. Ten have died, most of them residents of one suburban nursing facility. The county government bought a motel to quarantine infected patients. It is likely to get worse: Analysis by scientists who studied the local cases indicates that the virus may well have been present in the area for up to six weeks. Like the seasonal flu, the coronavirus is most dangerous to the old and medically vulnerable, but the only way to halt its spread is to change nearly everyone’s behavior.\n\nThe tech companies that dominate this region’s economy have been the most aggressive in making changes. Microsoft and Amazon moved quickly to cancel nonessential travel. Amazon, Microsoft and Facebook have recommended that employees in the area work from home if they can until the end of March. Yet the Emerald City Comic Con, which drew nearly 100,000 people last year to downtown, is still on. Flights continue at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Passengers are screened for the virus as they arrive from China, but Seattleites are not necessarily screened as we depart.",

    "article_text": "Those findings, in turn, inform policy recommendations. When does it make sense to shut down schools or workplaces? When will closing a border make a difference, and when won’t it? World health officials consult with social network modelers on a near daily basis, and Dr. Vespignani’s lab is part of one of several consortiums being consulted in the crucial and perhaps disruptive decisions coming in the next few weeks. On Friday, in an analysis posted by the journal Science, the group estimated that China’s travel ban on Wuhan delayed the growth of the epidemic by only a few days in mainland China and by two to three weeks elsewhere. “Moving forward we expect that travel restrictions to COVID-19 affected areas will have modest effects,” the team concluded.\n\n“Today, with the enormous computing power available on the cloud, Dr. Vespignani and other colleagues can model the entire world using” publicly available data, said Dr. Elizabeth Halloran, a professor of biostatistics at the University of Washington and a senior researcher at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. “On the one hand, there is the rise of network science, and on the other, there is the enormous rise in computing power.”\n\nDr. Vespignani came to network analysis through physics. After completing a Ph.D. in his native Italy, he took up postdoctoral studies at Yale, where he began to focus on applying computational techniques to epidemiology and geographical data.\n\n“Look, I am Roman, and I am a fan of Lazio,” the soccer team, he said. “We were in first place — finally, after how many years? — and some fans think the coronavirus is a conspiracy against Lazio. I don’t say this to be funny, but to say: Each social network functions in its own way.”\n\nHe was on his feet again and roaming past a row of glass-walled offices. At one point he stuck his head into an office where Ana Pastore y Piontti, a physicist and research associate, was working on one of the problems du jour: school closings, analyzed state by state and region by region. Health officials across the country are grappling with whether to close local schools — which ones, how soon, and for how long.",

    "article_text": "Editor’s Note: Turkey, where Kia Vaughn has been competing, suspended its soccer, basketball and volleyball leagues due to the coronavirus outbreak, Youth and Sports Minister Muharrem Kasapoglu announced Thursday.\n\nDearica Hamby looked beside her, saw her mother and 3-year-old daughter and just wanted to go home with them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut as countries around the world take action in the face of a global pandemic, Hamby couldn’t simply book a flight from Italy and return to the United States. Like many American-born WNBA players overseas, she had other factors to consider such as travel restrictions and financial and legal consequences.\n\nHamby was in a gated fortress in southern Italy, near the end of her season with Virtus Eirene Ragusa, a women’s basketball team in the Serie A1 league, as the spread of COVID-19 quickly grounded sports in the United States to a halt last week. Hamby said she was well during a phone conversation Sunday, and by all accounts healthy, but she has not been tested for the coronavirus.\n\nHamby would have had to have been exposed to the virus and showing symptoms to get tested in Italy. Just two weeks ago, Hamby had traveled to Milan — the most-affected region in a country with 31,506 cases and 2,503 deaths as of 10 a.m. ET on Wednesday — and played Virtus Eirene’s regularly scheduled March 3 game against Basket Costa. Afterward, Hamby was frustrated.\n\nGames were being canceled well before sports leagues started shutting down across the globe, but Hamby still played. The lack of direction and infrastructure as the virus spread was making an already dire situation worse.\n\n“For like two days I was just kind of crying, because I really wanted out,” Hamby told The Athletic.\n\nHamby’s team continued practicing when they returned to southern Italy, but as the situation escalated, she had to quickly adjust. Cities in northern Italy had gone from a yellow zone to a red zone, requiring everyone who was in the area or had recently been there to self-quarantine. Hamby also had her mother and daughter to worry about, but they weren’t included in the same 14-day quarantine policy.\n\nWhen President Donald Trump issued the European travel ban over the weekend, Hamby wanted to get her family home. Hamby knew it would be easier for her mom and daughter to travel separately before the government confirmed the details of the ban and the ability of American citizens to return home. Besides, Hamby couldn’t leave just yet.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring Italy’s nationwide lockdown, even moving between towns without an “auto-certifying” form for pre-approved reasons results in a three-month prison sentence or a fine of 206 euros ($230). Hamby had purchased a ticket to leave Italy on Friday with her family. If she had gotten on that plane, she could have been denounced. If she was unknowingly carrying the virus, infected someone else and it proved fatal, she could face a three-to-five-year jail sentence.\n\n“I really want to go home at this point,” Hamby said. “Obviously, I’m losing my mind because I can’t play basketball. I can’t work out (in a gym). I was like, I might just take the risk and get on a plane because each day I still don’t know what’s going to happen. Trump could wake up tomorrow morning and say, ‘That’s it, all flights done,’ and then I’m stuck out here.”\n\nHamby was determined to find the fastest way back, but first she had to close out her quarantine period. Her flight is now scheduled for Wednesday. Once the Las Vegas Aces forward is stateside in Atlanta, she’ll self-quarantine again.\n\nHamby was clear that her desperation to leave didn’t outweigh the risk of exposing herself or others to the virus. She’s watched it move through one part of Italy and is concerned with what will happen when it takes hold of the southern region, which is known for its elder population and underdeveloped medical facilities, and spreads even more across the U.S. Last week, Italy declared the entire country a red zone.\n\nIt’s still unclear how the pandemic will affect the 2020 WNBA season. The league issued a statement last week to say it’s monitoring the situation and will have more details later this month. The earliest WNBA event is the draft on April 17, followed by the start of training camp on April 26, preseason games on May 1 and the regular season openers on May 15.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut first, more players have to get home. Following the 2019 WNBA season, nearly 90 players spread out across 15 countries to supplement their annual income in overseas leagues. Some returned before the outbreak reached extreme proportions. Others, like Hamby and Alexis Peterson, were planning their return trips. Then there’s Kia Vaughn, the newly acquired Phoenix Mercury center, who still has games to play and, if she leaves before the Turkish Federation suspends or cancels the rest of the season, would violate her contract.\n\nPeterson, signed to the Mercury’s training camp roster last preseason and waived before final roster cuts, feared she would be stuck in Poland. Soon after her Pszczolka AZS-UMCS team held a recent meeting to discuss ending the season, the league made the decision for them, canceling it. Peterson had planned to leave Sunday, but as the virus spread more aggressively in the U.S., she had to adjust her plans.\n\n“I needed to try to get home immediately,” Peterson said. “I’m not going to lie, I was really afraid because my first thought was, ‘I can’t get stuck here.’”\n\nShe got word of Trump’s European travel ban through her mother, who woke her up at 2:30 a.m. to let her know she needed to get home immediately. Peterson logged onto her computer and watched as flights started rapidly selling out. She was finally able to find one that would get her home to Columbus, Ohio.\n\n“This is definitely foreign territory for everyone. It’s kind of like you got to learn as you go, honestly, and figure it out as you go,” Peterson said. “Because, as I was saying to some of my other friends, there’s no way we could have ever thought this would happen. How can you plan for something like this?”\n\nWhile leagues like Peterson’s have taken action and canceled their seasons, others remain in limbo. Vaughn, who plays for Elazig IL Ozel Idare (or Elazig) in Turkey, was carrying on with her game schedule over the weekend. Elazig’s opponents, which included other WNBA players, were flying into Turkey from their respective locations to play. Vaughn thought: Are people getting screened? How can we stop the virus from spreading?\n\nElazig took extra measures to help keep the arena clean, placing hand sanitizing stations by nearly every entrance and exit overnight. The Turkish Federation announced games would be played behind closed doors, but players, referees and various staff members were still coming in close contact with each other.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n“The really scary part is, where has everyone been?” Vaughn said.\n\nGames will continue as scheduled for Elazig and the rest of the teams in the Turkish BSL. Regardless of precautions being taken in empty areas, Vaughn has to weigh the cost of playing and her health — she suffers from asthma and severe allergies that already weaken her immune system. Vaughn has communicated with her agent, Lindsay Kagawa Colas of Wasserman, and knows she could face serious repercussions for leaving before the federation makes a decision on whether to stop play.\n\n“Anything can change at any moment,” Vaughn said. “My anxiety and my health is fine right here. I should quarantine myself in my own apartment here, rather than going to the airport and be among people that could have it and then, God forbid, I get it.\n\n“If I leave now, I leave money on the table and then I’m going to have to spend extra money to quarantine myself (at home) too, just in case to keep everybody safe.”\n\nMany agents have ramped up their efforts to identify the safest way to get the athletes home. Patricia “Ticha” Penicheiro, a WNBA/FIBA certified agent with Sports International Group, Inc. (SIG), was on the phone through Friday night trying to contact all of her players. The next step — navigating the international travel scene for her clients — was like jumping through a series of hoops that kept getting smaller and smaller.\n\nOnce the NBA suspended its season indefinitely last Thursday, and other sports leagues and governing bodies followed suit, Penicheiro knew the worst was yet to come.\n\n“It really hits home because these are athletes, you relate more to them,” Penicheiro said. “Sometimes athletes think they’re superhuman, they have all these powers, they are investable, and nothing can happen to them. And then, when you see the NBA players that are in amazing shape, they’re young, they should have a high immune system and you realize that they are affected and tested positive. That’s when you really start saying, ‘Oh, you know, this is real.’”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith everything still in flux, from leagues overseas to the WNBA season, there’s little comfort to give and more questions than answers.\n\nWNBA commissioner Cathy Engelbert has said “the health and safety of players and employees is of the utmost importance.” They are consulting with world health specialists and planning scenarios around the upcoming events and season.\n\nIf the WNBA season does begin at some point this summer, the league will have to consider the health and safety of its players traveling domestically. Unlike in the NBA, WNBA teams fly commercial, shuffle through airports and take charter buses, which means the players will come into close contact with others.\n\n“We don’t have the luxury of the NBA where we can disinfect our plane and everybody’s tested before they get on,” Penicheiro said. “We don’t know if everybody’s (healthy), we don’t have that luxury. If this still is still lingering, I don’t think we’re going to start the season on time just because we can’t control it, and we depend on a lot of other factors more than the NBA does.”\n\nThe news, the updates, the timelines refreshing throughout the day is frightening. The rate that the coronavirus is spreading even more so.\n\nBut first, the players have to come home.\n\n(Top photo of Dearica Hamby: Jeff Bottari / NBAE via Getty Images)",

    "article_text": "“It started for me with a pretty severe sore throat.” “I started to feel symptomatic five days after traveling.” “It’s different than the bronchitis that I’ve gotten before.” “Everything had kind of settled in my lungs. And I was just coughing a ton.” “I had a headache and felt feverish.” “It felt like I had a bowling ball on my chest. Nobody’s willing to see me, and nobody has the test kit and even C.D.C. is refusing to test me.” “I traced back, you know, my wife, she works at Amazon. They had a confirmed case.” “Four different planes in four different airports. So I don’t know who sat next to me or who I was in contact with.” “It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.” “We’re going down, not up. We’re going very substantially down. Not up.” “Anybody that needs a test, gets a test. They’re there. They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful.” “We have a president saying anyone who wants tests can get a test. And I’m thinking, That is so not true.” “It was just interesting, because there was this kind of gray area for a while of people who felt like they were really sick and should have been tested just as, even as a rule out. And the state of Washington just did not have the capacity to do that, because the government had not supported us at that point essentially.” “I got through to public health after about an hour, and they told me that I did not meet the criteria for being tested.” “They said, ‘There’s no way to get tested. We don’t have tests right now. There’s nothing set up in Delaware.’” “I looked at the C.D.C. website and it said, call your doctor if you have the symptoms. So I called the doctor’s office and they told me to go to an urgent care facility. I called an urgent care facility and they said that there’s nothing that they can do. And they don’t have the tests. And they told me to go to the E.R. And I called a hospital, and they told me that they don’t have the test either.” “I just felt like I was getting the run-around. It was clearly obvious that they just are under capacity, and they’re not able to test.” “I eventually just gave up because, at that point, the testing criteria was so strict. It was, you travel to China or have you been in contact with someone known diagnosed Covid. And I didn’t meet any of that.” “As a nurse in an E.R., it’s pretty vital if I have an infectious disease that I know what it is because I could be spreading it to people who are really vulnerable.” “I actually work in a building that’s a fairly public place. There’s people of every generation coming in there. There’s a private school there. There’s a senior center.” “Southwest Florida is full of elders. There is a lot of snowbirds coming here. They’re all in their 70s and 80s. I cannot get myself, like I cannot convince my conscience to leave the house just thinking about that, Hey you went grocery shopping and now like five people died. So I just self quarantined myself and basically started working from home.” “We stocked up on food items as much as possible. I bought a 25 pound bag of rice. We bought beans. We got ready basically just to hunker down for those two weeks. At this point, I’m telling people like make — if you have a decision to make, think about survival and make the decision based on survival for yourself, your family and your community.” “We knew this was coming. The federal government is just completely bungling this, and our lives are at stake. I feel like they’re just leaving us here to die in Seattle.” “The most overwhelming feeling was you are on your own.” “I’m just really concerned for those that this is going to affect the hardest. And I think we pretty much failed at early testing, early containment. We had more time than other governments.”",

    "article_text": "Milan, New York, New Delhi, Madrid — just a few of the many global cities that are shut down to prevent the coronavirus pandemic. And then, there’s Mexico City. Here, off the bustling Paseo de la Reforma, there’s an unsettling sense of normalcy. Flight attendants, newly arrived from the United States, walk around carefree. “I think on the one hand, it’s refreshing for us because we’re coming from a place that’s taking extreme precautions. We are on a petri dish most of the time, so I might already be exposed — more likely on the plane than probably here.” Mexico has documented four deaths from Covid-19. One man died after attending a large music concert. Doctors say the virus is already spreading in the community. “We don’t have tests, so we are having low numbers of patients that are infected.” Dr. Francisco Moreno oversees nine Covid patients at Mexico City’s ABC Hospital. He’s self-isolating, so I interviewed him remotely. “Do you think Mexico could be as bad as Italy?” But Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has continued to say there is no cause for alarm, and resists the measures other countries have taken to slow the virus’s spread. This was his message in early March. López Obrador, also known as AMLO, has continued to hold political rallies around Mexico, shaking hands and hugging admirers. Other government officials may encourage social distancing, but he asks people to go out and spend their pesos. But according to a recent O.E.C.D. report, Mexico has fewer nurses and fewer intensive care beds per capita than Italy, South Korea and the U.S. A count of ventilators in state facilities revealed only about 2,050 machines in the entire country. International leaders have criticized López Obrador’s response to the crisis as irresponsible. The president of El Salvador even begged Mexico, via Twitter, to take more drastic measures so as not to become the next epicenter of the pandemic.",

    "article_text": "michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today, a strategy of containment was supposed to protect Washington State from the coronavirus. It didn’t. Mike Baker on what led to the first major outbreak in the U.S. It’s Thursday, March 5th. Mike, tell me about how this outbreak in Washington State starts.\n\nmike baker\n\nSo it really began January 20.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nTonight, the C.D.C. is confirming the first case in the U.S. of a new and deadly coronavirus. A man in Washington State has the same virus that has sickened about 300 people in China, killing at least six.\n\nmike baker\n\nThat was when the officials here announced that the first case of coronavirus in the United States was in Washington State. It was in north of Seattle. There was a man in his 40s who had been traveling to the Wuhan region in China. He had come back. He had developed symptoms after he returned to the United States. And as kind of a savvy guy, he certainly made the connection that he was potentially infected with the coronavirus, and presented himself at a health clinic in the area to ask for some help.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what happens to him? How is he treated?\n\nmike baker\n\nOfficials there, the doctors take a sample. They’re sending it off to the C.D.C. There’s certainly an awareness this very likely could be a case. He ends up being taken to the hospital and quarantined there in a special portion of the hospital. At that point, you have health officials sort of tracking down who was he on the plane with when he returned? How did he get from the airport back to his house? What was he doing in the hours and days after he landed? So there’s a huge effort just to find out who might have been in contact with him, to make sure that this wasn’t going to be spreading further.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what were the results of those efforts to track people he might have been in contact with?\n\nmike baker\n\nThey ended up tracking dozens of people. And I don’t believe any of them ended up developing symptoms. We went six weeks here in Washington State without another case popping up. There were a number of tests done on a couple dozen people, and none came back positive. So there was certainly a sense that the case that had shown up on the shores here was one that was contained.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo far, so good.\n\nmike baker\n\nYes. In fact, there was a press conference last Thursday where the state still just had one confirmed case, the first case. And they talked publicly about how the risk to the general public remained low.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK, so what happens next?\n\nmike baker\n\nOn Friday, I’m working, helping colleagues around the west coast track coronavirus cases that are starting to emerge. And there’s cases in California, cases in Oregon. And then I get a notification that at 8:00 PM on Friday night, the health officials here in Washington State were going to have a press conference. And 8:00 PM press conferences generally are not a sign that good information is about to come out.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFair.\n\narchived recording (jeff duchin) I’m Jeff Duchin. I’m the Health Officer for Public Health, Seattle and King County. And I’m here to share with you that we have a preliminary positive result for COVID-19.\n\nmike baker\n\nSo at that meeting, they announced two new cases.\n\narchived recording (jeff duchin) A woman in her 50s, a female who traveled to South Korea, was visiting.\n\nmike baker\n\nThey have a woman who was traveling in South Korea came back and tested positive.\n\narchived recording (jeff duchin) And noted symptoms at the end of the workday when she got home on Tuesday. And on Wednesday evening, her husband called to report her symptoms and travel history to us. And we had her tested yesterday.\n\nmike baker\n\nAnd then they also had a teenager.\n\narchived recording (jeff duchin) As Dr. Lofy mentioned, we do have a new case of coronavirus in Snohomish County.\n\nmike baker\n\nA high schooler in the area, whose tests came back positive, as well.\n\narchived recording (jeff duchin) — have today for a school-aged adolescent. This individual became ill on Monday with fever, body aches and a headache.\n\nmike baker\n\nThe remarkable thing about those two cases is here, the state and federal governments had been spending much of their time focused on tracking people who had come back from Wuhan or from mainland China. Those are the people are getting screened at the airports. Those are the people who are getting tested. And here we had two cases that really didn’t fit that pattern at all, they weren’t really on that standard set of guidelines where testing would have taken place.\n\narchived recording (jeff duchin) There was no travel history associated with this case. Our team is still in the midst of the contact investigation, so we do not yet know the possible source of infection.\n\nmike baker\n\nAlong with cases in Oregon and California, we’re sort of setting this new standard that this wasn’t just people coming back from China anymore. There were people who were in our communities who are getting the virus. And no one really knew where it was coming from. And so in the middle of these questions about whether we’re testing the right people, whether the regimen around the country is going to catch the cases that might be here already, there is an escalation in the news.\n\narchived recording (jeff duchin) Today Public Health, Seattle and King County is announcing three new presumptive positive cases of novel coronavirus, COVID-19, including one person who died. And I want to just start by expressing our deep and sincere condolences to the family members and loved ones of the person who died.\n\nmike baker\n\nA Washington State man has now died of the coronavirus. It’s the first death in the United States. It’s a man in his 50s in the Seattle area who lived at a nursing home.\n\narchived recording (jeff duchin) The person who died was a patient at Evergreen Hospital who had underlying health conditions.\n\nmike baker\n\nAnd he had not traveled abroad, either. We now have got three cases in Washington State not connected to China, two of which appear to have developed the virus within the community somewhere. And so the announcements come out. Governor Jay Inslee declares a state of emergency. The governor suggests the use of, potentially, the National Guard if needed.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nmike baker\n\nAnd then the main area of focus that emerged at that point was this nursing facility in Kirkland, in the Seattle suburbs, owned by a company called Life Care. Officials were reporting that potentially dozens of people were sick there. They were showing signs and symptoms, a mix of both residents and staff. And obviously, this is — it’s a terrible place for a coronavirus to take root. I mean, you’ve got people who are elderly, who have medical issues. I mean, those are the exact types of people who would be most vulnerable to any kind of illness. And there was an immediate sense that there’s potential disaster ahead, with people there who are infected and spreading. We started talking then to a number of different family members of people, who were obviously worried and trying to figure out how to support their family members that are inside the facility. And one of those people that I talked to one of those first days was Bridget Parkhill.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd I called Bridget. And from the first moment we were on the phone, it was clear that she was very frustrated with this experience.\n\nmichael barbaro Hi, Bridget. bridget parkhill Yes. michael barbaro Hey, it’s Michael Barbaro. How are you? bridget parkhill I’m fabulous. How are you. michael barbaro I’m reading a little facetiousness in your voice. bridget parkhill Yes, just a bit. It’s been a pretty rough week. michael barbaro I imagine it has been. bridget parkhill Yeah.\n\nmike baker\n\nHer mother was in the facility trying to recover from knee surgery. She’d been there for a few months. And Bridget and others were just trying to get a handle on what was going on inside.\n\nmichael barbaro Bridget what are you thinking when you hear that this nursing home is suddenly in the news and is connected to the coronavirus? bridget parkhill Well, it is extremely scary to me. My mom has been a resident there since November when she had her knee replaced. And then all of a sudden, I’m getting frantic phone calls from my sister saying that two people had tested positive for this coronavirus. One was an employee and one was another resident, and that they were on lockdown. michael barbaro So as you get this information, what are you thinking to yourself? bridget parkhill I’m thinking, my god, mom’s had a cough since last Tuesday and she needs to get tested right away. So when I called them, I said, has my mother been tested yet? And it was the social worker I spoke with. And she pulled up mom’s chart, and she said, no. We’re going to test 50 people and your mom hasn’t had a fever. And she told me mom’s last three temperatures and they were fine. And at that point, they were taking them, I believe, every four hours.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBridget’s pressing them to get her mom tested to get a real answer it here on whether or not she has the coronavirus. There’s a great fear from her and the rest of the family that this could get much worse and. If she does, in fact, catch the coronavirus, she’s someone who was a really high risk of dying.\n\nmichael barbaro So what happens? What happens next? bridget parkhill Well, we just kept trying to call. We called the King County Health Department, because we were told to go through them to see should we be self-quarantined? Should we be doing something? michael barbaro Basically, should you, yourself, be quarantined? bridget parkhill Yes, exactly. And I couldn’t get a hold of anyone. My sister got a hold of someone, and they said, oh, this is the wrong number. This is the emergency line. You need to call this other number. So they were giving us the run-around. And so finally, this guy said, OK, I’ll take your information and someone will give you a call back. But no one did. michael barbaro No one called back. bridget parkhill No one called back. So she finally got a hold of someone, and they said, oh, no, if your mom doesn’t have a fever, no, you don’t have to do anything. You’re just fine. michael barbaro And you would explained that your mom was in a facility where coronavirus was known to have infected people. bridget parkhill Yes. michael barbaro And that you had been there. bridget parkhill Yes. michael barbaro Did any of that reaction surprise you? bridget parkhill Very much so. Very much so. They just acted like it was no big deal.\n\nmike baker\n\nAnd that’s a theme that we’re hearing from a lot of the family members, who are feeling like they’re just in an information black hole right now at a time when it seems like there is an extreme risk to the health and lives of the people they love. I mean, we’re seeing an email chain that’s going around from Life Care where they emailed a bunch of family members, and actually kept all the email addresses open to each other. And subsequently, the family members have been responding over and over again with their outrage, and frustration, and concern they’re not getting the information they want. They have a lot of questions that are not getting answered. There is undoubtedly extreme concern about how people are doing in the facility, their health, and their exposure, and what kind of protection is available to them. It has been heartbreaking to listen to, because they feel so helpless. They feel like their family members are in this facility, and just sitting ducks waiting for this virus to come through. So as the family members are struggling to get the information and answers that they feel like they need, we get another bout of terrifying information. Some researchers here in the Seattle area had been working to trace the genetic sequences of two cases of coronavirus. They looked at both the first one that showed up in mid-January six weeks ago now. And then they looked at another case that showed up last week. And in their analysis, they can see that these two cases appear to be linked.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what do these genetic sequences of this virus tell us?\n\nmike baker\n\nSo what it indicates is that after the first person who got the coronavirus in Washington State six weeks ago, there appears to have been a series of transmissions, a number that we can’t even count at this point, that then led to a new person showing up with the virus in more recent days. So there’s a sign here that this has been spreading throughout the community undetected for weeks.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. So they’re saying that that first case and that last case, they’re not isolated cases. The genetics show that they are, in fact, linked through some vast number of transmissions that mean that somehow, that first person gave it to somebody else, who gave it to somebody else, who gave it to somebody else, and eventually gives it to this last person.\n\nmike baker\n\nThat’s right. So these researchers now believe that if, in fact, this virus has been spreading throughout the region for six weeks essentially undetected, that there are likely 300 to 500 other cases out there that we don’t know about, but potentially up to 1,500. We’ll be right back.\n\narchived recording Two people are now dead in a Seattle suburb today from the coronavirus, after state officials confirmed that COVID-19 has been spreading quietly for weeks. Six weeks — six weeks in Washington State. That means hundreds of undiagnosed cases could be out there. And experts suggest there are many more cases circulating than have been detected so far. People have to remember — confirmed cases are not the number of cases. Confirmed cases just means that we went through the big rigmarole to get them tested. You’ve heard that there’s about —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMike, once it becomes clear that we’re dealing with a real outbreak here — and according to those projections that you just mentioned could be 100, could be thousands of people infected — does access to testing for the coronavirus change?\n\nmike baker\n\nSo the local health officials here were talking very ambitiously about how they were going to be increasing testing. And it was more significant. They were doing about 100 tests a day, but at the same time, that’s 100 per day for the whole state. Their goal is to increase that capacity as time goes on to the point where maybe we’re doing more than 1,000 a day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut why aren’t they able to suddenly deploy thousands of tests more or less immediately? What holds that back?\n\nmike baker\n\nWell, part of it is a capacity issue. But the other thing is that while the C.D.C. guidelines on who should be tested have broadened, it’s still relatively narrow. The new guidelines essentially say that if you’re someone who is hospitalized with unexplained flu-like symptoms, you would get a test. But if you’re just a random person who has flu-like symptoms, and you’re concerned that you might have had coronavirus, that’s not enough for you to go to your doctor and be put in the pipeline to get tested.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo basically, there are just restrictions still on who’s eligible to be tested. And that seems quite stringent.\n\nmike baker\n\nThat’s right. Their official guidance is not everyone needs to be tested.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo at this point, what’s happening to people like Bridget’s mother, who has not yet been tested, may have been exposed to this virus? What is the protocol for people like her? What happens to her?\n\nmike baker\n\nSo right now, a lot of these people are essentially — they’re isolated in their rooms. They’re getting food delivered to them by people in protective gear. They’re trying to stay in touch with family through video chats and phone conversations.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what is she saying that that’s been like?\n\nbridget parkhill She said this is like solitary confinement. And we laughed about, wow, mom, I don’t know what your crime was, but you’re doing hard time. And she laughs, you know. My mom has a very big, bright personality, laughing all the time. She’s that kind of person. And so she’s trying to make light of it. But at the end of the conversations, she says, I’m just really lonely.\n\nmike baker\n\nAnd there’s hearing, through these family members, a lot of concern about how this is being handled, how long they’re going to be in isolation, and when this might end, and the larger, more concerning question — how is this going to end for them?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMeaning are their family members going to survive this.\n\nmike baker\n\nThat’s on their minds all day long. One of the things that’s a real struggle for the family members like Bridget was that they can’t see their family members right now. They can’t go into the facility, because it’s in quarantine.\n\nbridget parkhill So we were told that they were under lockdown, but I really needed to see my mom. So my sister and I decided to meet there, and bring her a little care package, because they said that we could certainly bring her food, or books, or whatever we wanted to, and just to call them when we got there.\n\nmike baker\n\nSo Bridget talks about how the other day, she went to the facility, went to the front door.\n\nbridget parkhill So I called, and they said that someone would be right out. And there were signs that said, “No admittance,” that they were having a respiratory outbreak. So a woman came out and said that she would take it to mom. And I said, wait a minute. We can’t go in. Is there any way that I can go around outside to her window, and just see her, just wave at her so she knows that I’m here?\n\nmike baker\n\nWould it be OK If she walked around the exterior of the building just so she could have a chance to see her mom.\n\nbridget parkhill And she said, oh, sure, no problem. So she took the goody bag down to mom and my sister and I went around the side. She opened up the blinds, and there was my mom. With all this stuff going on, just seeing her gave me so much relief, just because we are getting so little information from Life Care Center that we don’t know. Is she able to sit up? Is she laying in a bed? You know we had no idea. So it was just thrilling to see her sitting up, and smiling, and waving. michael barbaro When do you think you’re going to be allowed to see your mother? Are they giving you any kind of frame? bridget parkhill They’ve given me no time frame whatsoever. They don’t know. There’s ambulances going in there. And they take people out, and take them to the hospital. So I’m just waiting for that call to say that my mom is one of those people. michael barbaro Oh, no. bridget parkhill [CHOKED UP] It’s really hard.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Mike, by the end of this past weekend, from everything you’ve said, the government in Washington has pronounced a state of emergency. It’s acknowledging that things are quite serious. Testing is still very limited. People are furious about that. And from the projections you described, it’s clear that the virus has been spreading and spreading, and maybe, at this point, kind of out of control. So what is the plan by the authorities there to wrap their hands around this crisis?\n\nmike baker\n\nSo there was really a major shift that was happening, because the news was just cascading worse and worse every time. I mean, every time they would give us an update, it was more people in critical condition. It was another death, more deaths. You had this growing cacophony of horrible news coming out from the region. And so then on Monday morning, we really see that sort of change in direction and messaging.\n\narchived recording This morning, we are in final negotiations to purchase a motel in which we can place patients who are in need of isolation and a place to recover.\n\nmike baker\n\nThe county executive here in the Seattle area comes out, and says, they’re now going to be going out to buy a motel in the region that he could repurpose for the sake of isolating people who have coronavirus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\narchived recording The risk for all of us of becoming infected will be increasing.\n\nmike baker\n\nThe county health officer here was talking about how the number of cases here are growing so much that at some point, coronavirus cases are going to outpace the number of flu cases in the area.\n\narchived recording And there’s a potential for many people to become ill at the same time.\n\nmike baker\n\nAnd that means a whole different strategy. Now there’s so many cases that they no longer have the ability to track individual people and retrace their steps.\n\narchived recording So we are making both individual and community-level recommendations to limit the spread of this disease. And our community-level recommendations are very similar to what we recommend for influenza.\n\nmike baker\n\nThey’re shifting to a community-level approach here, that you’ve got to sort of address the problem at a bigger scale.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. So basically, they’re giving up on the idea of containing this by tracking each person who has it.\n\nmike baker\n\nRight. Now, I just got a message that came in, that said the latest guidance is that they are recommending that older residents with underlying health problems in the community stay in their homes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Mike, in a span of really just a few days here, the State of Washington has gone from just a handful of cases to a pretty extraordinary outbreak. And it feels like a kind of terrifying demonstration of just how fast this virus can take hold across a relatively small geographical area.\n\nmike baker\n\nIt is. I mean, we went from one known case a week ago to today, the latest was 39 total infections and 10 people dead. You can sense the growing fear around here. I mean, we have guidance that employers encourage people to telecommute instead of coming into an office. You’ve got schools preparing to educate students remotely if the virus continues to spread.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\narchived recording That could expand, also, to include, again, discouraging mass gatherings as we call them — sporting events, the high school basketball game, the hockey game, the convention. These things could end up becoming temporarily discouraged, if not possibly prohibited, depending on the escalation of concern.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMike, how reasonable is it to fear that what happened there in Washington, and the speed with which it happened, is going to be the story of how this unfolds pretty much everywhere else in the United States?\n\nmike baker\n\nI mean, we’re certainly seeing the spread everywhere at this point. One thing that I’ve stopped to think about a number of times in the last few days is, did this region just get really unlucky to have the epicenter of the outbreak take root in a nursing home, among the most vulnerable people in the region? And is that why the death toll is so high here? At the same time, the reality is the virus is continuing to spread. And the public health experts we talked to expect it to continue that way. And there’s going to be more places just like this that are going to get hit.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMike, thank you very much, and stay safe.\n\nmike baker\n\nThanks.\n\nmichael barbaro Bridget, for a lot of people the coronavirus is a kind of distant news story. It’s very scary, but it’s not yet a reality in a lot of places. In the Seattle area, and definitely in this nursing home, it is a reality and a very scary reality. And I wonder as somebody who has experienced it in a very personal and visceral way, what this experience has taught you about what it’s like when this virus does come into your life. bridget parkhill Well, when it comes to your own family, I can’t express to you what it is like. It’s fear. It’s every bad emotion you could have. And she calls me first thing in the morning when she wakes up. Just hearing her voice, it’s like, OK, everything’s good for another day. But is it going to be fine in an hour? Is it going to be fine in three hours? Is she going to make it through the night, because it’s so fast when the severe illness hits, that I don’t know.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe Times reports that in February, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention distributed a test for the coronavirus to state and local laboratories, but that flaws in that test led to inconclusive results. A replacement test was promised, but was never distributed. As a result, most diagnostic testing was only conducted at C.D.C.‘s labs in Atlanta, whose results took days. Last week, amid growing criticism from doctors across the country, the Food and Drug Administration finally broke the logjam by allowing state and local officials to conduct initial testing on their own. But tests remain scarce.\n\narchived recording Chairman, this is really a frightening time. I’m hearing from people who are sick, who want to get tested, who are not being told where to go. I’m hearing that even when people do get tested, and it’s very few so far, the results are taking way longer to get back to them.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDuring a hearing on Tuesday, U.S. Senator Patty Murray of Washington State lashed out at federal health officials over the shortage of test kits on behalf of her constituents.\n\narchived recording (patty murray) The administration has had months to prepare for this. And it’s unacceptable that people in my state and nationwide can’t even get an answer as to whether or not they are infected. To put it simply, if someone at the White House or in this administration is actually in charge of responding to the coronavirus, it would be news to anybody in my state. And I’ve been on —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAs of Wednesday, there were 44 cases of the virus in Washington State, and more than 150 in the U.S. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (michael bloomberg) If you remember, I entered the race for president to defeat Donald Trump. And today, I am leaving the race for the same reason — to defeat Donald Trump, because staying in would make it more difficult to achieve that goal.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Wednesday, Michael Bloomberg dropped out of the presidential race after a poor performance on Super Tuesday, in which he failed to win a single state, despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars on his campaign. From the start, Bloomberg’s candidacy hinged on Joe Biden’s campaign collapsing, something that never happened. On Wednesday, Bloomberg endorsed Biden, becoming the latest moderate candidate to do so.\n\narchived recording (michael bloomberg) I’ve always believed that defeating Donald Trump starts with uniting behind the candidate with the best shot to do it. And after yesterday’s vote, it is clear that candidate is my friend, and a great American, Joe Biden. [CHEERS]\n\nmichael barbaro",

    "article_text": "In early March, when the number of American coronavirus cases was still low and the president himself sounded unalarmed, Republicans generally told pollsters they were unworried, too. About 40 percent of them in a national tracking poll said they were not at all concerned about an outbreak in their communities. In that same moment, hardly any Democrats agreed.\n\nThat pattern, consistent across other surveys, seemed to suggest not long ago that Americans would view even a deadly infectious disease as they have come to see so many facets of life — refracted through pure partisanship.\n\nBut more recently this picture has begun to shift.\n\n“Not concerned at all” about a coronavirus outbreak in their local area Source: Civiqs\n\nAs the coronavirus toll has risen and the stock market has plunged, as the economy and daily life have come to a halt, and as the president and conservative commentators have changed their tone, Republican concerns about the virus are now rising. Political scientists expect that in short order the views of Republicans and Democrats may converge on how seriously they take the virus.\n\n“While the effects of partisanship are incredibly pronounced, I think they also hit their limits,” said Brian Schaffner, a political scientist at Tufts.\n\nIn the months ahead, we may well see persistent partisan splits on whether Americans approve of how the president is handling the crisis. But on the more fundamental question of how they perceive the threat in their personal lives, Democrats and Republicans are now moving in the same direction.\n\nBoth say they are growing more concerned about an outbreak in their local areas, according to a daily tracking poll by Civiqs. Since the stock market crash on March 9, the share of Americans of both parties who said they were “extremely concerned” about an outbreak has increased nearly every day.\n\nPartisan differences are eroding in part because the messages coming from President Trump, Fox News hosts and other Republican party leaders increasingly — if inconsistently — resemble the messages Democrats are hearing from their preferred news sources and leaders. Even some policy responses, like sending Americans money to weather the crisis, have received bipartisan support.\n\n“At some point, if everybody is saying the same thing,” said Ryan Enos, a political scientist at Harvard, “there’s reason to believe that that party gap should go away.”\n\nSome of these partisan differences may be because Republicans are more likely to live in rural communities, far from the first domestic outbreaks and in places where social distancing isn't such a challenge. But the cues people get from party leaders are also hugely important in shaping public opinion. And the president has gone from dismissing the virus as under control to addressing its dire consequences in daily briefings — all messages that have in turn been amplified by conservative media.\n\nIn responding to pollsters, both Democrats and Republicans have a tendency to “cheerlead” for their party — to give the answer that their team is supposed to give, even if that answer doesn’t reflect their true behavior, or if it contradicts indisputable reality. That may be part of what explains these early and stark differences in coronavirus concerns. Until quite recently, if you were a Fox News watcher, you weren’t supposed to be worried about the virus.\n\nMr. Schaffner, the Tufts political scientist, wondered if he could bypass what people were saying and look directly at how Democrats and Republicans were behaving. He found something like that evidence in online search data. In early March, people in Democratic-leaning media markets were much more likely to do a Google search for hand sanitizer — a trend that didn’t exist before the crisis.\n\nOver the last two weeks, that partisan pattern all but disappeared:\n\n↑ More searches for hand sanitizer More Repulican areas → In early March, places that were more Republican were much less likely to search for hand sanitizer. As the outbreak became more serious, and as party leaders communicated the scale of the problem, that divide diminished. Circles represent media markets; they are sized proportional to the number of households in each market. Google Trends are an index. · FiveThirtyEight, Nielsen Sources: Google Trends\n\nThere is also some evidence that Republicans in parts of the country hit first by the virus began to grow more concerned even before the president’s cues shifted. A national poll conducted by Survey 160 and Gradient Metrics, which oversampled Washington State residents, found that Republicans there were much less likely than Republicans nationally to say the crisis had been exaggerated by the media. On that question, Republicans in Washington looked more like independents across the country.\n\nIn state data from the Civiqs daily tracking poll, Republicans in Washington State have also shown for weeks the highest levels of concern.\n\n“Extremely concerned” about a coronavirus outbreak, state by state Source: Civiqs\n\nThat suggests that people in other parts of the country will grow more worried, regardless of their partisanship, as they learn more not just from TV anchors and presidential news conferences, but also from their sick friends and neighbors.\n\n“At a certain point, if they don’t know someone who has it, they’re going to know someone who knows someone who has it,” said Samara Klar, a professor at the University of Arizona. “And that’s not going to fall along party lines. Those kinds of things are going to make the partisan gap go away.”\n\nWhat’s perhaps more remarkable is not that the gap will ultimately narrow, but that it existed so starkly in the first place. Similar ideological divides haven’t been apparent in Britain. In the U.S., differences in level of concern between Democrats and Republicans — or between people who get their news from national newspapers or Fox News — have been far wider in YouGov polls than any of the differences by education, income, age or race.\n\nPast public health threats in America have shown some echoes of this partisan pattern. Republicans, for example, were more likely than Democrats to say they were concerned about the Ebola outbreak that occurred during the Obama administration.\n\nBut in the past, Democrats and Republicans behaved in some similar ways when faced with a public health threat, according to work by Bethany Albertson, at the University of Texas at Austin, and Shana Kushner Gadarian, at Syracuse University. They have studied the role of anxiety in politics when people confront threats like terrorism and disease. Facing a public health threat, they found, the more anxious Democrats and Republicans became, the more likely they both were to trust expert sources like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n“People want expert actors; they don’t want partisan actors in times of crisis,” Ms. Gadarian said. “What’s different now than in our studies is that our current president has been undercutting messages from the C.D.C. and other health experts about, first, whether or not this is a crisis, whether you should be anxious, and, second, what we should be doing.”\n\nShe and Ms. Albertson also suggest partisanship among the public and the media had grown more pitched than during H1N1 or even Ebola.\n\n“For weeks and weeks, this threat has been politicized, or made partisan, in a way that is quite stunning,” Ms. Albertson said.\n\nConsider the counterfactual where that trend continued, even in the face of a rising death toll and widening restrictions on daily life.\n\nIf Trump “had made less of a dramatic shift, you have to think about scenarios where conspiracy theories would be gaining more ground, the idea that ‘my kids’ schools were closed and it’s the Democrats’ fault,’” said Matt Grossmann, who directs the Institute for Public Policy and Social Research at Michigan State. “These are all possible alternative worlds if the parties weren’t converging in concern and threat at the moment.”",

    "article_text": "The SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus\n\nThe virus that causes Covid-19 is currently spreading around the world. At least six other types of coronavirus are known to infect humans, with some causing the common cold and two causing outbreaks: SARS and MERS.\n\nSpike\n\nproteins Proteins\n\nand lipids\n\nCovered With Spikes\n\nThe coronavirus is named after the crownlike spikes that protrude from its surface. The virus is enveloped in a bubble of oily lipid molecules, which falls apart on contact with soap.\n\nACE2\n\nEntering a Vulnerable Cell\n\nThe virus enters the body through the nose, mouth or eyes, then attaches to cells in the airway that produce a protein called ACE2. The virus is believed to have originated in bats, where it may have attached to a similar protein.\n\nProtective\n\nwrapping Viral RNA\n\nReleasing Viral RNA\n\nThe virus infects the cell by fusing its oily membrane with the membrane of the cell. Once inside, the coronavirus releases a snippet of genetic material called RNA.\n\nViral protein Viral RNA\n\nHijacking the Cell\n\nThe virus’s genome is less than 30,000 genetic “letters” long. (Ours is over 3 billion.) The infected cell reads the RNA and begins making proteins that will keep the immune system at bay and help assemble new copies of the virus.\n\nAntibiotics kill bacteria and do not work against viruses. But researchers are testing antiviral drugs that might disrupt viral proteins and stop the infection.\n\nCell nucleus Viral proteins\n\nMaking Viral Proteins\n\nAs the infection progresses, the machinery of the cell begins to churn out new spikes and other proteins that will form more copies of the coronavirus.\n\nAssembling New Copies\n\nNew copies of the virus are assembled and carried to the outer edges of the cell.\n\nSpreading the Infection\n\nEach infected cell can release millions of copies of the virus before the cell finally breaks down and dies. The viruses may infect nearby cells, or end up in droplets that escape the lungs.\n\nDebris from\n\ndead cells\n\nImmune Response\n\nMost Covid-19 infections cause a fever as the immune system fights to clear the virus. In severe cases, the immune system can overreact and start attacking lung cells. The lungs become obstructed with fluid and dying cells, making it difficult to breathe. A small percentage of infections can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and possibly death.\n\nLeaving the Body\n\nCoughing and sneezing can expel virus-laden droplets onto nearby people and surfaces, where the virus can remain infectious for several hours to several days. The C.D.C. recommends that people diagnosed with Covid-19 wear masks to reduce the release of viruses. Health care workers and others who care for infected people should wear masks, too.\n\nFlu vaccine Flu antibody Potential\n\ncoronavirus\n\nvaccine Antibodies\n\ntargeting\n\nviruses\n\nA Possible Vaccine\n\nA future vaccine could help the body produce antibodies that target the SARS-CoV-2 virus and prevent it from infecting human cells. The flu vaccine works in a similar way, but antibodies generated from a flu vaccine do not protect against coronavirus.\n\nHow Soap Works\n\nSoap destroys the virus when the water-shunning tails of the soap molecules wedge themselves into the lipid membrane and pry it apart.\n\nThe best way to avoid getting infected with the coronavirus is to wash your hands with soap, avoid touching your face, keep your distance from sick people and regularly clean frequently used surfaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources: Dr. Matthew B.

    "article_text": "But, if we’re being honest, calm isn’t why anybody comes back around to “Contagion.” It’s having our pressure spiked. Panic is a draw. And Soderbergh is the right guy to goose the dismay. He’s always practiced a filmmaking of neurotic compulsion: the doomsday obsessions of Andie MacDowell in “Sex, Lies, and Videotape” and James Spader’s complementary erotic fetish; the way Soderbergh essentially color codes his movies in blues, oranges and reds. I used to think the tinting was to help us follow all the story lines; now I think it’s to help him feel organized, that every element is in its place.\n\nSoderbergh’s OCD flag really flies in “Contagion.” The introduction of every city receives a head count: “Tokyo, population 36.6 million,” “Minneapolis, population 3 million.” Toward the end of the opening sequence, the camera peers down from Paltrow to the bowl of airport-bar peanuts at her elbows. It follows her credit card as it goes from her fingers to the attendant who swipes it. Anytime a hand touches a door knob or a pole on a subway or a bus, the camera and editing basically go “ewww.” For the severely infected, the camera angles go sideways and the images warp and blur.\n\nAt some point, a scientist played by Elliott Gould sits in a restaurant after spending a lot of brain power thinking about a vaccine and watches a waiter yawn while drying glasses and a coughing woman take a swig of water. Gould’s reaction is a face he had to invent for the occasion. It’s worth noting that Soderbergh does his own cinematography; those are basically his eyes boinging out of their sockets.\n\nAfter 45 minutes, my delight subsided. I remembered why I was watching this again. And the gravity of it all set in — deeper than something terrifying like the “28 Days” zombie movies, although not as movingly as a novel like “Station Eleven” or the archival footage AIDS documentary “How to Survive a Plague.” The movie’s potential death toll — 70 million, somebody says — seems high compared to what officials are surmising about Covid-19. But people are dying. The striking nurses and empty gyms, malls and airports; the panic to flee: It all feels real. The movie doesn’t predict the racism and xenophobia that have broken out in the United States. (Maybe you saw the clip of a nincompoop newsperson asking whether we could get the virus from Chinese food.) Instead, it has desperate Hong Kong villagers kidnap an important white lady in order to get them to the front of the vaccine line.\n\nSpeaking for those who’ve rehelped ourselves, I’m glad I did. There have been moments in the last few weeks when I’ve felt we might be paranoid. Everything smells of hand sanitizer and people are testing their core strength to surf the subway-car turbulence lest they have to grip a subway pole. The other day, I watched a businessman wipe an entire train seat with disinfectant and then park himself in it before it dried. I thought we might all be Julianne Moore in “Safe,” suffering from a disease we might not actually have.",

    "article_text": "One point that may seem to contradict the others is that distribution of any vaccine that is developed to prevent disease should prioritize older patients and those with serious underlying health conditions who are at greatest risk. This is because unlike the 2009 swine flu outbreak, when children were prioritized for vaccine because they were most susceptible, with Covid-19 older patients and those with serious health conditions have an elevated risk of dying.\n\nTo maximize the benefits of a vaccine for society, those most likely to die or to utilize large amounts of scarce resources if they become infected should be given the vaccine first. This should be modified, if it turns out children do not fall ill, but are a major source of coronavirus transmission. Giving children priority for vaccines would then be justified because it would help save others.\n\nFinally, when a vaccine is produced, there will initially be severe shortages. With 50 million Americans over age 65, 16 million who have emphysema, five million with heart failure and 30 million with diabetes, initially there will be more people who need the vaccine than can get it. Whom to choose? In this case, after vaccinating frontline health workers and other first responders, equality suggests a random selection, such as a lottery, among those in the highest risk category of dying from coronavirus.\n\nRationing lifesaving interventions is horrendously wrenching. No one wants to choose which patient gets a ventilator or vaccine, and which patient may die because he or she does not. For doctors and nurses this presents the specter of abandoning patients. It readily leads to burnout — and therefore less effective care. For patients and families, the denial of potentially lifesaving treatment generates feelings of disempowerment, being discarded and having one’s one’s worth denied. Some will erupt in anger. Others will be crushed. Many will feel betrayed by a society that was supposed to protect them. Understandably, as humans, we try to avoid such tragic choices at all costs. But Covid-19 — not humans — will force us to make those choices. The best answer we have is to make these choices as ethically as possible, and to alleviate pain and suffering.",

At noon on Feb. 25, just as Mr. Trump was boarding Air Force One in New Delhi for his flight home, she told reporters on a conference call that life in the United States was about to change.\n\n“The disruption to everyday life might be severe,” she said. Schools might have to close, conferences could be canceled, businesses might make employees work from home. She had told her own children, she said, to prepare for “significant disruption to our lives.”",

    "article_text": "michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: So far, the United States is losing the battle against the coronavirus. Donald G. McNeil Jr. on what it would take to turn the corner. It’s Tuesday, March 24. Donald, it is now about 4:20 on Monday. Where are we in this pandemic in the United States? How would you characterize it at this moment?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nI would say it’s wildly out of control, but we have not recognized it yet. Certainly wildly out of control in New York State.\n\narchived recording (news anchor) The epicenter in the U.S. is now clearly New York, with more than 12,000 cases, most of them here in New York City.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nIn Washington.\n\narchived recording (news anchor) The state of Washington has the second highest number, with almost 1,000 cases. And then there’s California. We have the third highest number.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nIn northern California, in South Florida.\n\narchived recording (news anchor) We saw pictures of Disney World jam-packed with people, aerial photos of beaches in Florida jammed with people. There are still so many Americans that don’t understand they are spreading the virus.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWe’ve just begun to do tests, really. We’ve got 42,000 positive cases. We’ve got 513 deaths.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYou know, some people have said this is like a war. And it’s as if your army has been marching forward, and the enemy has been shooting at you for two to three weeks now, and nobody has yet looked down to see whether or not they’re bleeding.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nBut very soon, we will see how many people have been hit. Because, you know, you get sick within four, five, six, seven days of getting infected. But usually you don’t need hospitalization — if you’re going to need hospitalization — until about 10 days to two weeks in. It’s known as the second week crash. And some people crash even after they thought they were starting to get better. So we’re facing something like that. A lot of people are sick, huge numbers of people are about to fall seriously ill.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nBut it just hasn’t happened yet.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, I want to talk about what the U.S. government and states have done so far. How would you describe what has been done to try to mitigate this?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nIt’s a giant patchwork across the country.\n\narchived recording (gavin newsom) This is a moment we need to make tough decisions. This is a moment where we need some straight talk, and we need to tell people the truth.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nI mean, you see California ordering people to stay inside their houses.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) So we’re going to put out an executive order today, New York State on pause.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nNew York requesting that people stay inside their houses and closing down all nonessential businesses.\n\narchived recording (news anchor) A stay at home order for all of Ohio.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYou have Ohio and Louisiana —\n\narchived recording (john bel edwards) Today, I’m issuing a stay-at-home at home water for the entire state of Louisiana.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\n— moving in the same direction.\n\narchived recording (john bel edwards) Which will become effective tomorrow Monday, March 23 at 5 p.m.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThe federal government has recommended no gatherings of more than 10 people. Some states are enforcing that even more harshly than that, like California. Other states are setting their own policies.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight, and as patchy and inconsistent as this approach may be, there is beginning to be real blowback to this government-mandated social distancing and shutting down our society, given that it is putting people out of work. It’s closing businesses. The president has said just in the past few hours —\n\narchived recording (donald trump) We cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself. We’re not gonna let the cure be worse than the problem.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHe doesn’t want the cure to be worse than the illness itself. So I want to understand why we’re pursuing this approach rather than a variety of alternatives. And let’s start with the South Korean approach, right? Not closing all businesses, not closing all restaurants, focusing instead on aggressively tracking the sick and testing as many people as possible. And it seems to be working, right? So why can’t we do that here? Why isn’t that a viable alternative to shutting things down?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWell, we could do that here, if we had a time machine and we could travel back in time to about January 20, because January 15 is where we know one of the first cases arrived in the United States and started spreading. That was the case in Washington. The idea that we could try to start cracking down now, when we have over 40,000 cases and 500 deaths, it’s just utterly impossible. It’s not close to anything that South Korea faced. I mean, South Korea, they were doing this kind of crackdown when they first saw cases arriving, before there was a single death. So we’re just behind the eight ball on that kind of thinking. And mostly they had small scattered cases, and then they had this gigantic explosion inside one church. I think it was more than 500 cases inside that church. All right, they managed to do contact tracing on 210,000 members of that church. Los Angeles just gave up contact tracing today.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nJust knowing that they don’t have the tests to do it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMeaning, tracing those who were in contact with somebody who has tested positive.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nTracing everybody who was in contact with somebody who was tested positive. Not only everybody they’ve been in contact with since they knew they were infected, but everybody even 48 hours before that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo not only is it too late to follow the South Korean model, you’re saying, as an alternative in the U.S., we just don’t have the capacity or the resources to follow it.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nCorrect.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK, so we can dispense with that. Another possible alternative to just shutting everything down is isolating the most vulnerable in American society to the coronavirus. So the elderly, those with pre-existing conditions, underlying medical problems, rather than asking everyone to isolate in some form or another. And in that scenario, most Americans would be treated as we treat most Americans during the regular flu season, right? Take some precautions, be careful but don’t fundamentally alter your life. And there are doctors who seem to be advocating for this “isolate the most vulnerable” scenario. And one of our colleagues, columnist Tom Friedman, gave voice to their views over the weekend. And it seems President Trump is interested in this kind of a concept. What do the experts that you have talked to say about the viability of that?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThis was an idea that was floated for a while in the Netherlands, and was floated for a while in the U.K., and dropped because they realized that it was ridiculous. Why is it ridiculous? One, how do you only isolate the elderly?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nElderly people in this country very often live with their families. Elderly people need services, which people deliver to them in their houses. Or they go to community centers, or to their relatives houses for services they absolutely need, from everything from food to company. How do you isolate the vulnerable? How do you isolate everybody who’s obese in this country?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhy do you mention obese?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nBecause many have diabetes. And diabetes is one of the conditions that renders you more susceptible to dying of this disease. Everybody who’s got high blood pressure, not all high blood pressure but uncontrolled high blood pressure, which a lot of people do in this country, is more susceptible to this disease. Anybody who’s taken any sort of immunosuppressive drugs or is fairly recently beyond cancer treatment may be more susceptible to this disease.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThere’s some data suggesting now that people who vape may be more susceptible to developing pneumonia from this disease. Vaping is not something that’s common among the elderly in this country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you’re saying, there are just too many vulnerable populations for this to be practical?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes. So the idea that you can just isolate all the most vulnerable people in the U.S. is simply wishful thinking.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo given that, Donald, I want to talk through another possible alternative, one that President Trump seems to be talking up a lot in the past couple of days.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) It’s a common malaria drug. It’s been available, so therefore the safety level we understand very well. It’s been relatively safe.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhich is the idea that we are close to a treatment to the coronavirus, something that would reliably combat it, and mean that we don’t need to shut down societies.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) We’re also studying this and other promising therapies, which is a therapy produced by Gilead. And that would be rems — it’s called remdesivir, remdesivir — and it shows great promise.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo tell me about these drugs that President Trump has been referring to and whether he is right to suggest that they might be a solution here.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nOK. The drugs that President Trump has mentioned over the past week are chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which are two versions of a longstanding malaria drug. Goes back 70 years. And the other drug is called remdesivir, and it’s a drug made by Gilead, and it doesn’t actually have any use. I think they may have hoped it would work against H.I.V., and it didn’t. It definitely did not work against Ebola when they tried it. Now they’re hoping it works against coronavirus. There’s some evidence to suggest it does. I mean, there’s evidence in animal testing to suggest that both of these drugs might possibly work.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThose drugs have been used in China. But this was by doctors who were desperate, who were basically throwing everything they had at patients.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nAnd in some cases, where doctors had a certain number of patients that said, gee, these patients seemed to do better when I gave them that drug. Now, that doesn’t mean this was some sort of Lazarus-like rise from your hospital bed and walk away smiling miracle drug. This was a drug that seemed to let these patients have better outcomes. But they weren’t able to do, for several reasons, real clinical trials, where you have two groups of patients who are basically exactly equal to each other and half of them get the drug and half don’t. That’s what you need in order to be sure that a drug really works. Once you license a drug, then doctors start giving it all over the place. Actually, chloroquine is already licensed, so doctors are giving it in the hopes that it will work, and patients are demanding it in the belief that it will work, the belief partially spread by the president. And we don’t really know how well it works. And these drugs are not completely safe. They shouldn’t be taken, especially by children, without medical supervision. And the fear is that false hopes will be raised. And that also people get so excited about it that some may start taking the drugs to protect themselves out of fear, if they’ve managed to get a hold of a bottle, and they may end up poisoning their kids. These are bad outcomes. There is a case where the cure is worse than the disease.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo beyond the fact that there’s not yet enough medical evidence that this is a legitimate set of treatments, there’s potentially real medical risk in people starting to take them, because they might actually make people sick.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK, so with all those options basically deemed impractical, that would seem to bring us back to social isolation. But is that working? Because my sense is, so far in the United States, it is not working.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nNo, it’s not working. And that’s because we’re not doing it right. And, you know, to write the articles I’ve been writing recently, I talked to a dozen top experts, not just at the World Health Organization, but people who run medical schools, people who have fought pandemics, people who fought Ebola, people fought SARS, people who fought MERS. And they say that if we’re going to get a grip on our epidemic, we have to imitate China, because we’ve got China-like spread. We’re not going to be able to catch it up with a South Korea-like program, and we’re going to have to do a whole lot better than Italy and Iran did. And we’re not on that track right now.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back. So if the U.S. is failing at social isolation, what would the ideal version of social isolation look like right now? What would it entail?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nSo in an ideal world, if you could wave a magic wand and make everybody in the United States freeze in place, sitting six feet apart from each other for two weeks —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\n— we could stop the epidemic in two weeks. If we had enough —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nReally?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYeah, because within two weeks, the virus would die out on every surface that it was. People wouldn’t be interacting, so they wouldn’t transmit it. And everybody who has symptoms, the symptoms turn up in two weeks at the most. So you’d know who was sick. And even for the few asymptomatics, you’d be able to find them by doing tests. And so that’d be it. Epidemic over. I mean, you’d have a lot of people in the hospitals, but that would be the end of it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nKnowing that we don’t have a magic wand but wish we did, what do we do? What’s the playbook for how to keep people away from each other in the United States, given where the virus is?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nAs much as possible, we have to stop everything in places where we know the virus is. That is what China did. They knew the virus was incredibly hot in Wuhan and the surrounding province, and so they put that entire province on lockdown. Unfortunately, that means not just stopping all air travel, it means basically stopping all travel.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nI mean, people can’t be together on buses. People can’t be together on planes. People can’t be together in cars, unless it’s just them and they’re going to socially isolate together when they get to the end of their journey, and stay in place for, unfortunately, an indefinite amount of time. The loosey goosier the freeze is, the longer it lasts. And the longer it’s going to take us to get our economy started again. Because the looser it is, the more transmission there is. The more transmission there is, the more people end up overcrowding hospitals. The more people overcrowd hospitals, the more people die.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK, so that’s transportation. And you’re suggesting that, in many ways, we have to further restrict that. What about businesses? What about restaurants all over the country? Do they need to be shut down?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes, all of these things. Transportation, restaurants all over the country, schools all over the country, workplaces all over the country, bars and restaurants all over the country. And different places are turning into hotspots spots even as we speak, because people are now traveling all over the country and still spreading the virus, starting new clusters. The only way to get on top of this disease is to stop the clusters.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn this scenario that you’re describing, what can be open? What’s an acceptable reason for anyone to be out and about?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nDoctors, nurses, people who work in the health care field. Police, fire, the people who keep the water mains open and the electrical grid running and Wi-Fi reaching houses. And food delivery and medicine delivery. That’s the ideal. Those are the only people who are allowed out and that keep the country functioning. We need people to freeze in place, and we need to make sure they have enough calories and water and medicine to stay alive.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYou know, not that they are worried about how their business is running and how their investments are going or whether or not they’re collecting their rents. And we have to do things like tell landlords that they can’t collect their rents, tell banks that they can’t collect their mortgages. The idea is to keep the country alive until the virus slows down. It may be impossible, but if you want to try to use any sort of social distancing tactic, it has to be much more intense than it is now, because we’re not slowing the virus. It’s still spreading wildly.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd this slowdown, how would it be enforced in a place like the United States? Let’s say that suddenly every state, every mayor locks down a community along the lines of what experts say needs to be done now to freeze this in place. How does it actually get enforced? Who is in charge of punishing those who violate it, roaming the streets and making sure it actually happens?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWell, I mean, legally you can do it. The governor and the health commissioner have the power to use the police to enforce these laws. In Italy, as in China, they went to roadblocks everywhere. You couldn’t drive down a street without a permit that had been issued by the government that said, I’m an emergency worker. I am allowed to drive down the street. That’s what will have to happen if people don’t do it voluntarily, and I fully expect that Americans are not going to do this voluntarily. But then we’re going to suffer the consequences.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo what happens if we don’t do all the things that experts are saying we must do, the social isolation, the lockdowns? I mean, it doesn’t seem we’re headed there. So what happens if we don’t implement any of these measures?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nIf we don’t implement these measures, we will have a Wuhan in New York, and a Wuhan in Seattle, and a Wuhan in South Florida, and a Wuhan in Wheeling West, Virginia, and a Wuhan in Helena, Montana, and so on.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nBecause hospitals will get overwhelmed everywhere. And in Wuhan, in the early weeks of the epidemic, the death rate was 4 percent to 6 percent. It’s a little unclear, because there were people who couldn’t make it to the hospitals and just died at home. But if you go on the South China Morning Post site and you look for the videos that were shot then, you’ll see hospitals with people crowded in the corridors and literally dead bodies lying in the halls, that nobody’s had time to take away. You’ll see nurses and doctors screaming, having breakdowns, screaming in frustration, I can’t take it anymore, I can’t take it anymore. You will see lines of coffins outside the crematories, just sitting there waiting for their turn to go into the furnace, because there’s too many coffins for the flames to burn fast enough. I mean, we have seen that in Wuhan and we’ve seen it in Italy, where they were having to stack coffins on the pews of the churches that had been closed down, because there was no place to put the coffins and they couldn’t dig graves fast enough. So that’s what we’re headed for.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI mean, it’s horrific.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYeah, yeah, yeah. And we’ve — I’ve been looking at this stuff since late January, early February, and frightened by it. The visions are nightmarish, and I don’t see anybody taking it seriously. But that’s what we’re headed for.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt’s kind of hard to process this, because what you’re suggesting is that a short term, essentially, shutdown down of much of our life in the U.S. would potentially bring this whole pandemic to an end. And yet there are a lot of practical reasons why that would be very, very hard to imagine. But for those who are very skeptical of it, and who think, as the president said, that the cure may be worse than the illness, it would seem like a short-term version of this would be kind of ideal, right? Because it would happen —\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWho said short-term? I said if there were a magic wand, you could do a short-term shutdown. I think for the shutdown to be effective, given how lax Americans are about staying in the shutdown, we have got to have a shutdown that lasts for months and months.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo there’s no short-term version of this, given the way the U.S. operates.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThere’s no magic wand. There’s no 15-day cure.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat’s pretty depressing, because it means that there’s almost nothing we can do right now. That the genie is out of the bottle, the horses have left the barn, the pandemic is too deeply in our system.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nIn New York, I think that’s true. We don’t know exactly how many people have been infected, but we know that it’s been incredibly hot with virus out there for awhile now. And yet people are really struggling, because, you know, they haven’t had their Rock Hudson, ‘here’s somebody I know who’s got the disease, so now I believe in it,’ moments. People are still — they’re beginning to hear about colleagues who were sick, colleagues who were infected and stuff, but that only began four or five days ago. People beginning to need to be hospitalized in large numbers is usually 10 days, and the deaths don’t usually take place until three to six weeks. So we have a lot more pain in the future.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut is it possible for other cities in the U.S. — smaller cities, maybe even mid-sized cities, not New York, not Seattle, maybe not Los Angeles — to do these things and spare themselves?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes. And it will take those Bruegelesque visions of New York to convince them that this is what’s headed their way.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hm.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nAnd maybe they’ll take the actions they need to. And maybe they won’t.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI’m thinking back to the phrase you used to describe the way the United States is handling this right now — as a patchwork. Do you think, Donald, that we are going to be ending up in a kind of awful middle place, where many of us are at home, we are isolating in lots of big parts of the country, but it’s not enforced significantly enough and uniformly enough to have meaningful impact? And so rather than having the magic wand version of this, we have the worst version of this, which is, there’s a lot of burdens, social and economic, and still the virus keeps spreading and spreading.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes, I think that’s exactly what’s going to happen. There’s going to be a great deal of economic impact, but we’re not going to be able to find the political will or the fear as a people to shut down the spread of the virus. I don’t see us flattening the curve, as everybody has talked about. Maybe some other cities will be able to flatten the curve later. Once they see what’s going to happen in New York, they’ll begin to believe that they have to flatten the curve, and they’ll go in. But then you’ll find out how many people were infected in the meantime. I mean, we’re going to come out of this as a different nation, a different people. If we essentially don’t shut down so that the chain of transmissions don’t stop, we’re going to be looking at hundreds of thousands of dead, I think, unless some drug turns out to be a miracle preventive. And that’s the high hope for the chloroquine, but we don’t really know that yet. And we know there’s not going to be a vaccine for a year. So short of that, we may have to shelter in place for a year until a vaccine rolls out. Look, I hope for better.\n\n[music]\n\nBut I’m not trying to sugarcoat it. I’m trying to explain what the worst case scenario is. I hope we don’t reach the worst case scenario, but I fear that we are a long way down the road towards it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, I would like to say thank you, Donald, but it just doesn’t seem like that kind of a conversation. Thank you, anyway. We appreciate it.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThank you. Sorry. I’d love to be proved wrong.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday, during his daily briefing on the pandemic, President Trump continued to promote medications that have not been widely proven as effective in treating the disease and said that thousands of doses of one of them — chloroquine — would be distributed to New York City despite misgivings from federal health officials.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) America will again, and soon, be open for business. Very soon.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAt the same time, the president said that he was eager to quickly end the economic shutdown now in place to halt the spread of the virus, in defiance of advice from his medical advisers.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Our country wasn’t built to be shut down. This is not a country that was built for this. It was not built to be shut down.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHere’s what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) The time has now come for us all to do more. From this evening, I must give the British people a very simple instruction. You must stay at home.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday, Britain issued a virtual lockdown, closing all non-essential shops, banning meetings of more than two people and requiring citizens to stay in their homes, except for trips for food or medicine.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) The way ahead is hard, and it is still true that many lives will sadly be lost.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn the United States, where there are now about 42,000 infections, federal officials warned that the virus was spreading at an alarming rate in New York, where 28 percent of tests are coming up positive, compared with a national rate of 8 percent.\n\narchived recording (dr. deborah l. birx) So to all of my friends and colleagues in New York, this is the group that needs to absolutely social distance and self-isolate at this time. Clearly, the virus had been circulating there for a number of weeks to have this level of penetrance into the general community.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn Congress, Senate Democrats again blocked a nearly $2 trillion stimulus bill, which they argue favors corporations over workers, infuriating the Republican majority leader, Mitch McConnell, who accused the Democrats of seeking to exploit the crisis.\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) They ought to be embarrassed, Mr. President. In fact, I’ve heard from some of them who are embarrassed. Talking like this is some juicy political opportunity. This is not juicy political opportunity. This is a national emergency.\n\nmichael barbaro",

    "article_text": "Facing an accelerating spread of Covid-19, Italy and Japan have closed schools to impede the epidemic. Some communities in the United States have done so too, agreeing to significantly disrupt people’s lives on the theory that it will prevent deaths and serious illness.\n\nBut there is no clear evidence that such measures will slow this outbreak.\n\nMost of what we know about the impact of school closings on disease transmission relates to influenza, to which children can be particularly vulnerable, sometimes dying or becoming seriously ill from it.\n\nChildren are important drivers of influenza infections because they have more interactions with people than do most adults and also give off more of the virus. Closing schools, it is assumed, reduces the number of contacts and thus the rate of transmission.\n\nDuring the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, schools across the country were closed. A C.D.C. study showed that parents largely supported these measures, but other studies found that children frequently got together outside the home or visited public sites, despite official recommendations not to do so. Fortunately, schools reopened in less than three days in most cases because data showed the flu strain wasn’t as severe as had been feared.",

Two went into respiratory distress. Others had fevers so high that they had to be separated from the rest of the travelers aboard the chartered flight.

At one point, she took over the in-flight announcements and begged passengers to donate spare peanuts to help revive those who were passing out from low blood sugar.\n\n“It was probably scarier than the cruise,” Ms. Catron said of the flight, which landed at about 6:30 a.m. Friday and then idled on the tarmac in Atlanta for about five hours, because health officials learned that three of the evacuees had tested positive for the coronavirus.",

They asked to remain anonymous, because what they’re doing could put them and their families at great risk. But these people are part of a new wave of Chinese citizens, fighting to get the message out in a country that aggressively censors information. Accounts or messages like these calling for free speech are quickly scrubbed from the internet. Or videos like this, showing people frustrated about life under lockdown. [clanging] Posted online one day, but gone the next. But the crisis over the coronavirus is changing the landscape, for now at least. Everyday citizens are preserving and reposting information the government doesn’t want out there. Experts say this kind of digital resistance is happening at a scale they’ve never seen before. Social media networks like YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are blocked in China. But internet savvy people use techniques that allow them to repost censored content to these platforms, while staying under the radar of authorities. They’re creating a visual archive by preserving videos like this one, showing overwhelmed hospitals. [screaming] And they’re reposting people’s personal stories. Some are also turning to less obvious platforms, including GitHub, which is a site mostly used by coders. Another taboo Chinese citizens are pushing back on? They’re making open and widespread calls for freedom of speech. These were triggered by the death of Dr. Li Wenliang. He was an early whistleblower who warned about the virus, and was punished by officials for speaking out. He died in early February from the coronavirus. Right after his death, the hashtag “I want freedom of speech” started to trend on Weibo, a Chinese social media site. Then, it was quickly censored by the government. Dr. Li’s become an icon in the online fight for freedom of speech between censors and citizens. So, who’s winning? For now, citizens are staying a step ahead of the authorities. But a renewed government crackdown could test the strength of this digital resistance.",

While surgical masks can block only large-particle droplets, N95 masks filter out 95 percent of all airborne particles when used correctly. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend that they be used only by people with infectious respiratory illness and health care workers who treat or otherwise come in contact with them.\n\n“It’s not just about the patients identified as having the virus,” said Dr. Wendy Armstrong, another infectious disease specialist at Grady, who is more accustomed to using N95 masks to evaluate patients who might have tuberculosis. “It’s also about the people you are evaluating to rule out the virus, and the testing is not instant.”\n\nProtecting health care workers from the virus is essential to managing the epidemic, to ensure hospitals, urgent care centers and other facilities can handle inevitable surges in sick patients. A number of doctors and nurses around the country have already been quarantined for two weeks after patients they interacted with tested positive for the virus; health care workers in China have gotten sick and even died amid extreme shortages of masks and other protective gear.\n\nThe federal government’s Strategic National Stockpile of medical supplies includes 12 million medical-grade N95 masks and 30 million surgical masks — only about one percent of the 3.5 billion that the Department of Health and Human Services estimates would be needed over the course of a year if the outbreak reaches pandemic levels. The department announced last week that the federal government had put in a guaranteed order for 500 million N95 masks over the next 18 months, a move it said would encourage manufacturers “to immediately increase production of N95s for use by health care professionals.”\n\nA spokeswoman for the health and human services department said the first step for hospitals experiencing shortages was to ask their local or state public health department, many of which have their own emergency supplies.",

    "article_text": "michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”\n\n[music]\n\nLast week, President Trump sounded newly serious about combating the coronavirus, calling himself a quote, “wartime president.” Maggie Haberman on why days later, and with the situation only worsening, the president is abandoning that message. It’s Wednesday, March 25.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nHello, guys.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHi.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nHi.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMaggie, it is Tuesday afternoon. Can you tell us about what just happened on the Fox News Channel?\n\narchived recording (bill hemmer) Over the next two hours, the president, the vice president, and the officials tasked with leading our nation’s response on the virus pandemic will join us to answer your questions all across America.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe just saw Vice President Mike Pence and President Trump sit for two hours at a town hall meeting — virtual town hall meeting — with Fox News from the White House, where they took questions by remote.\n\narchived recording I think a lot of us right now are just wondering, what is the potential for a national stay-at-home order? Is this something that America could be seeing in our near future?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nPence answered a bunch of questions first.\n\narchived recording (mike pence) Carly, I can tell you that at no point has the White House coronavirus task force discussed what some people call a nationwide lockdown.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThen, President Trump came on for the second hour.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) Our people are full of vim and vigor and energy. They don’t want to be locked into a house or an apartment or some space. It’s not for our country. We’re not — we’re not built that way.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd his message was even louder of a message that he’s been delivering for the last day or so, which is that while we have to take the coronavirus seriously —\n\narchived recording (donald trump) You know, I don’t want the cure to be worse than the problem itself.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\n— in his words, the cure can’t be worse than the disease.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) — the problem being, obviously, the problem. And you know, you can destroy a country this way by closing it down.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd by that, he means that the hits to the economy are becoming unsustainable. That it can’t go on forever.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) You’re going to lose people. You’re going to have suicides by the thousands. You’re going to have all sorts of things happen. You’re going to have instability. You can’t just come in and say, let’s close up the United States of America, the biggest, the most successful country in the world by far.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd then he broke some news.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) I’d love to have it open by Easter. OK? I would love to have it open by Easter. archived recording Oh wow, OK.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd that news was that he believes that by April 12, which is Easter, that that could be when the country and its economy are reopened.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) It’s such an important day for other reasons, but I’ll make it an important day for this, too. I would love to have the country opened up and just raring to go by Easter.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMaggie, this seems very much at odds with the messaging coming from more local leaders and health officials in the areas of the U.S. that have been most directly hit by this pandemic so far. I’m thinking, for example, of the governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, who was warning New York residents —\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) Look, this can go on for several months, OK?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n— that they should be preparing for four, six —\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) — eight months, nine months.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNine months of life under isolation and shutdown to fight the coronavirus.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nMichael, about half an hour or so before Mike Pence started this town hall —\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) You have 20,000 ventilators in the stockpile. Release the ventilators to New York.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\n— Andrew Cuomo was pleading with the federal government to send more resources, especially ventilators, because the number of cases that are severe in New York is growing and keeps getting bigger and bigger. And it is outpacing the number of materials that they have for doctors to treat them.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) I need the ventilators in 14 days. Only the federal government has that power.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nYou have health officials in New York, health officials in California, health officials in President Trump’s own government saying we are not just a mere two or three weeks away from things going back to normal. And they’re basing that not just on idle projections, but watching what those curves have looked like in terms of the spread of the virus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAlso, Maggie, help us understand how we got here and why this is the message from the president at this critical moment — when how we respond, what measures we take, and how long we take those measures really matters. And so I wonder where you think that starts. Where do we begin to understand that?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nMichael, you need to go back to January 22 when the president was in Davos for the World Economic Forum.\n\narchived recording (joe kernen) It’s great to see you. Thank you for joining us again in Davos. We’ve done this before. archived recording (donald trump) That’s right.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd he did an interview with CNBC. And at that point, the virus was already in the U.S.\n\narchived recording (joe kernen) The C.D.C. has identified a case of coronavirus in Washington state.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd he was asked by the interviewer if he was concerned that this could become a pandemic.\n\narchived recording (joe kernen) Have you been briefed by the C.D.C.? archived recording (donald trump) I have. archived recording (joe kernen) Are there worries about a pandemic at this point? archived recording (donald trump) No, we’re not at all.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd the president’s response was, no, not at all.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine. archived recording (joe kernen) OK.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nHe didn’t want to talk about it publicly at the time.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd why do you think that was?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nWell, according to a number of people who were in contact with him, it was because he didn’t want to rattle the financial markets. That he was hoping that it was going to stay under control, and the stock markets are his political weathervane, and he thinks they need to stay up in order for him to win re-election. And he didn’t want to do anything to disturb that. And he didn’t want to create a panic.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOK. So what happened next?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nSo after that, a couple of days later, as there were more cases and it was clear that it was spreading out of China — where it originated — the president took this move that he was widely criticized for by Democrats and even some Republicans at the time. Which was he halted a number of flights from China into the U.S.\n\narchived recording (sean hannity) Disney’s closed. archived recording (donald trump) Yeah. archived recording (sean hannity) Movie theaters are closed. Hospitals being built. I think we’re now up to our eighth case in the United States. How concerned are you? archived recording (donald trump) Well, we pretty much shut it down coming in from China.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThe idea was to halt the spread of the disease, keep transmissions to a minimum. He was accused of xenophobia. He was accused of making a racist move. At the end of the day, it was probably effective, because it did actually take a pretty aggressive measure against the spread of the virus. The problem is, it was one of the last things that he did for several weeks.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm. So the right decision in retrospect, but not accompanied by similar actions that might have contained transmission.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThat’s exactly right. In the same way that George W. Bush was criticized for his “Mission Accomplished” banner about Iraq, the president treated that moment as if it was his mission accomplished moment. He did not do anything after that in terms of alerting the public, or telling people to be safe, or telling people to take precautions. And it basically squandered several weeks within the U.S.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. Looking back at the timeline, we can now see that on the same day that the president stopped those flights from China, the coronavirus was already being reported by the W.H.O. in Japan and South Korea, and those countries are still sending their citizens to the United States on flights that have not been stopped. So the horse is out of the barn.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nExactly. It was not anything close to a “whole-of-government approach.” And at that point, there was a task force that was formed, and it was being led by the health and human services secretary, Alex Azar. But it was outside of the White House, and it was rife with all kinds of turf battles. And the president, meanwhile, was still trying not to talk about it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd succeeding in that, for the most part.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd succeeding in that, for the most part. It was not something that came up in interviews that he did, which were mostly with friendly interviewers who weren’t going to ask him things that he didn’t want to talk about. And look, it’s not as if it wasn’t getting news coverage. The New York Times had it on the front page almost every day from the end of January. It was very clear that this was a global crisis, but it was not being treated as an American crisis. And I think a lot of that is because the president just was not talking about it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd do we know what information the president is receiving during this time? Is he getting a bunch of briefings — one would think he would be — that are conveying the seriousness of the approaching situation?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThere’s conflicting information, Michael, about exactly how specific and how alarmed the briefing materials the president was receiving were at this time. We understand that a lot of folks in the National Security Council were taking it very seriously, and that information had been passed to him. We understand that Alex Azar, the health and human services secretary, took it very seriously, but it’s not clear that he was sharing all of that with the president or that he was being allowed to tell it to the president. There were some people in the White House who viewed Alex Azar in particular as quote-unquote “alarmist” — thought that he was overstating the threat. And when the president doesn’t want to take something particularly seriously, he’ll often poll test advisers until he finds the one who agrees with him that he shouldn’t take it seriously. And I have every reason to believe that he was looking for people to affirm his sense that this didn’t really need to be addressed. And one of the places that he would go to hear his own thoughts affirmed or for solace was Fox News.\n\narchived recording (jeanine pirro) If you’ve ever had a question whether the mainstream media distorts, whips up, throw things out of focus or has an agenda, especially when it comes to the Trump administration, look no further than coronavirus.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThey were very much echoing what he believed and wanted to believe, which was that the criticisms about inactivity that he wasn’t doing enough was all part of an effort to harm him.\n\narchived recording (trish regan) This is yet another attempt to impeach the president. And sadly, it seems they care very little for any of the destruction they are leaving in their wake — losses in the stock market. All this, unfortunately, just part of the political casualties for them.\n\n[music]\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAt this point, the president is in India being fitted by Prime Minister Modi, and public health officials start basically taking matters into their own hands. They start giving public warnings. One top health expert gave a press briefing where she said that —\n\narchived recording (dr. nancy messonnier) Now, it’s not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but rather more a question of exactly when this will happen.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nIt was no longer a question of if the virus would spread in the United States, but when.\n\narchived recording (dr. nancy messonnier) And how many people in this country will become infected, and how many of those will develop severe or more complicated disease.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd that hospitals and businesses and schools should start making preparations accordingly.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThis was as the president was now on his way back from India, and the stock market reacted terribly to these warnings. And the president was furious. He called the health and human services secretary, saying that the remarks had rattled people. He called one of his top economic advisers, Larry Kudlow, wondering what could be done to stop the slide. But at this point, as angry as the president was, it was clear to him and to his advisers that this was no longer something he could ignore.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back. So Maggie, what happens once the president recognizes that this is something that has to be addressed?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThe president put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the task force.\n\narchived recording (mike pence) Good afternoon. We just completed today’s lengthy meeting of the White House coronavirus task force.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd that was a big moment, because this task force that had been kind of diffuse and fighting with itself was for the first time being run from the White House. And it was meant to signal that the president was taking this seriously. So Mike Pence had control of this thing for basically two weeks. And during that time —\n\narchived recording (mike pence) We’re continuing to lean into this effort in full partnership with state and local health authorities around the country —\n\nmaggie haberman\n\n— he was trying to communicate that they were working on a plan —\n\narchived recording (mike pence) — to ensure that we do everything to prevent the spread of the disease.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nTo address the spread, that they were working on guidelines, that they were aware of problems with testing for this virus that have plagued this administration for weeks.\n\narchived recording (mike pence) To mitigate its expansion and to provide necessary treatment to Americans that have been impacted.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd after two weeks, Vice President Mike Pence was getting a lot of praise for his demeanor in these briefings.\n\narchived recording (mike pence) If I may, we’ll be back here every day. Get used to seeing us. We’re going to bring the experts in. We’re going to make sure and give you the best and most high quality, real time information from the best people in the world. So thank you all for being here. archived recording Thank you. You’re welcome back any time.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd that became a point of concern for some of President Trump’s own advisers, who didn’t want to see Mike Pence get all of the attention.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh. So the people around the president didn’t want the vice resident, rather than the president, to be the one seen as quarterbacking this major national crisis?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThat’s right. There was concern among the president’s top advisers that it would look as if Vice President Pence was basically doing the job the president should be doing — calming a nation, giving out accurate information, sounding as if he’s in charge. And that led to this idea that the president should give an Oval Office address. So on March 11, the same day the W.H.O. declared the coronavirus a global pandemic, President Trump sat in the Oval Office behind the Resolute Desk at 9 p.m., and the klieg lights came on and the teleprompter started rolling. And he gave an address to the nation.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) My fellow Americans, tonight I want to speak with you about our nation’s unprecedented response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nFor the first time, he acknowledged that this could impact older people.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) The highest risk is for elderly population with underlying health conditions. The elderly population must be very, very careful.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nHe talked about a ban on most travel from Europe.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) To keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days. The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nBut the address, which was brief, as Oval Office addresses usually are, was seen as a disaster.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhy?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThe President looked uncomfortable. He stumbled over the teleprompter, which he never does well with.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) I am confident that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures, we will —\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nAnd it was riddled with errors, including about the travel ban.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) — and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade in cargo, but various other things as we get approval.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nHe suggested that it would apply to cargo and trade. It didn’t, and those mistakes sent the stock markets plummeting.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. And my assumption was that the President hoped the speech would do the exact opposite, which is it would give confidence to the stock market and send it back up.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThat’s right. The markets continued to tank over the next couple of days. And aides started realizing that there had to be a major course correction or the presidency could be threatened. And the President realized this too. So on March 17 —\n\narchived recording (donald trump) I would like to begin by announcing some important developments in our war against the Chinese virus.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\n— we saw a pretty different tone from President Trump as he talked about this virus.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) We’ll be invoking the Defense Production Act just in case we need it. Last week, I signed an emergency declaration under the Stafford Act.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nHe described it soberly. He suddenly seemed willing to answer questions without being combative.\n\narchived recording (journalist) Do you consider America to be on a wartime footing in terms of fighting this virus? archived recording (donald trump) I do. I actually do. I’m looking at it that way, because you know —\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nHe described himself as a wartime president. He seemed to be taking this seriously in all of the ways that a nation usually looks for a leader to take such a crisis seriously.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) It’s a very tough situation, here. You have to do things. You have to close parts of an economy that six weeks ago were the best they’ve ever been. We had the best economy we’ve ever had. And then one day you have to close it down in order to defeat this enemy. But we’re doing it, and we’re doing it well. And I’d say the American people have been incredible.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThis was dramatically different from what we had heard just a few days earlier.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWell, so, Maggie, how then do we get to today, where one week later, the situation with this pandemic has only gotten dramatically worse? The virus is exploding in places like New York. The number of infections and deaths are rising across the country. And yet, the president’s message has now kind of reverted back to where it was weeks and weeks ago. His language has changed. His overall comportment and the words he’s using — they’ve all kind of returned to a period where he was not taking this as seriously.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThere have been people in the President’s circle who, this entire time, even as the President changed his tone, still thought that some of the moves that the government was making were too aggressive. And those aides started, late last week, talking about the fact that they might want to revisit some of these guidelines and ease up on some of them for targeted groups after this initial 15-day period had ended, which is going to be March 30th. The president started getting the message in earnest on Sunday night that this is something that he needed to worry about. That there might not be an economy to return to once the country was fully back to normal. And so he tweeted on Sunday night that the cure couldn’t be worse than the disease. And that was the beginning of a massive shift of the federal government, which had moved toward aggressive measures to mitigate this virus and its spread, to suddenly suggesting that they could see the end nearing.\n\n[music]\n\narchived recording (donald trump) We can’t lose a Boeing. And we can’t lose some of these companies. And companies — frankly, Bill — that were solid as, like, AAA companies. Because of what’s happened over the last couple of weeks, they go from AAA to being, like, they could use a hand. archived recording Tough time. archived recording (donald trump) We can’t — you’re right. We can’t lose those companies. If we lose those companies, were talking about hundreds of thousands of jobs, millions of jobs. The faster we go back, the better it’s going to be. We have a pent-up energy that’s going to be unbelievable.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIs there a meaningful contingency of conservative leaders, thinkers, and politicians, economists even, people in business who feel this way, who feel like there’s been an overreaction to this virus in the form of shutting down the American economy?\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThere are. Some of them are people who have been the president’s advisers on and off for a while, like Stephen Moore of FreedomWorks, who’s an economist and who advised the president at various points. He wrote an op-ed for The Wall Street Journal with Art Laffer, who the president gave the Medal of Freedom to not that long ago. And in that op-ed, they said, essentially, that the government can’t sustain this. That the economy can’t sustain this. And that there needs to be less draconian moves made to keep people safe but still allow the country to run.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm-hmm.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nThere is no public health expert in the government telling the president that these moves are too severe. There is no public health expert in the government telling the president that the curve is about to let up on the spread of the virus. Everything the president has done about this virus has been a reaction to something, and right now he is reacting to pressure to reopen portions of the economy, as the job losses are facing potential millions by April.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, I don’t know whether the President would frame it this way, but I wonder if he’s forcing all of us to reckon with what is the ultimate moral dilemma of this pandemic, which is what economic and social cost we’re willing to pay to save some uncertain number of lives. And he seems to be saying, in effect, I’m willing to take the risk that a certain number of Americans will get sick and will die for the greater economic good and health of the United States.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) I mean, think of it. We average 36,000 people — death, death. I’m not talking about cases, I’m talking about death. 36,000 deaths a year. People die, 36 — from the flu. But we’ve never closed down the country for the flu. So you say to yourself, what is this all about? Now — archived recording How did you — archived recording (donald trump) It’s never been done. archived recording How did you process that? archived recording (donald trump) Not good. I wasn’t happy about it.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nMichael, I think that’s very much what he’s saying. And in fairness to him, Governor Cuomo has openly voiced the same moral dilemma that he is wrestling with. It’s just that Governor Cuomo came down on the other side of it, which was that there is no cost that can be put on human life.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) Yeah, my mother is not expendable. And your mother is not expendable. And our brothers and sisters they’re not expendable. And we’re not going to accept a premise that human life is disposable. And we’re not going to put a dollar figure on human life. The first order of business is save lives, period. Whatever it costs.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nNew York has been, as we know, much harder hit than most of the rest of the country. Most of the rest of the country has not had to go through what New York is going through right now with surges in hospital stays and a number of sick people. The president says most of the country agrees with him, and maybe that’s why.\n\n[music]\n\nBut the president is taking a really large gamble, and going with his gut, that the greater good will be served for the rest of the country by trying to preserve the economic health of the country more quickly than his health experts would like him to.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMaggie, thank you very much.\n\nmaggie haberman\n\nMichael, thank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Tuesday night, Dr. Anthony Fauci, an infectious disease specialist and an influential member of the president’s coronavirus task force, was asked about the president’s plan to reopen the U.S. economy by Easter.\n\narchived recording (journalist) Where are you now with this timeline of 19 days from now? archived recording (dr. anthony fauci) So that’s really very flexible. We just had a conversation with the president in the Oval Office talking about, you know, you can look at a date, but you’ve got to be very flexible.

    "article_text": "And while the acute shortages are global, not just in the United States, some European governments are deploying wartime-mobilization tactics to get factories churning out more ventilators — and to stop domestic companies from exporting them.\n\nThe United States, by contrast, has been slow to develop a national strategy for accelerating the production of ventilators. That appears to reflect in part the federal government’s sluggish reaction to the coronavirus, with President Trump and others initially playing down the threat. This week, Mr. Trump urged governors to find ways to procure new ventilators. “Try getting it yourselves,” he said.\n\nThat will be hard and in some cases impossible.\n\n“The reality is there is absolutely not enough,” said Andreas Wieland, the chief executive of Hamilton Medical in Switzerland, one of the world’s largest makers of ventilators. “We see that in Italy, we saw that in China, we see it in France and other countries. We could sell I don’t know how many.”\n\nMr. Wieland’s company is shipping machines as fast it can get them off the assembly line. He has moved office workers to the factory and hired more employees. Even so, he can’t keep up with the crush of orders. “Italy wanted to order 4,000, but there’s not a chance,” he said. “We sent them something like 400.”\n\nThe coronavirus attacks people’s lungs, in some cases compromising their ability to breathe. Ventilators, which deliver air to the lungs through a tube placed in the windpipe, are a crucial tool to keep these patients alive. The computerized, bedside machines can cost as much as $50,000.",

The city’s public health authorities announced her case on Saturday evening and have been referring to her as “a patient under investigation.” The authorities have cautioned that she may not have the new virus.\n\nOn Sunday evening, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene announced two more possible cases. Both patients are older than 60, the authorities said. One is currently at Flushing Hospital Medical Center, the other is at NewYork-Presbyterian Queens. Both hospitals are in Flushing, Queens.\n\nOver the last two weeks, the New York City’s Health Department has sought to reassure the public and encourage people to continue with their daily routine. Those who recently traveled from Wuhan or elsewhere in China were told that there was no need to self-quarantine so long as they felt fine and were symptom-free.\n\nBut the federal government has issued new restrictions, including a quarantine policy that went into effect at 5 p.m. Eastern time on Sunday.\n\nThat policy bars most foreign nationals who have been in mainland China in the past 14 days from entering the United States. American citizens who have been to Hubei province — Wuhan is the capital city of Hubei — will be taken into mandatory quarantine upon entry into the United States, or directly to a hospital if they are found to be “symptomatic,” said Rick Cotton, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates Kennedy International, La Guardia and Newark Liberty International Airports.\n\nAmerican citizens who are returning from elsewhere in China will be instructed to self-monitor their health and will be “subject to restrictions on movements outside their homes,” Mr. Cotton said.",

But the guidelines, which officials described as a trial set, are not mandatory and fall short of a national quarantine and internal travel restrictions, which many health officials had urged.\n\nAnd they do not reflect the urgency of actions taken around the world as governments in Italy, France, Spain and elsewhere began imposing stringent lockdowns on citizens. Even within the United States, local governments were imposing shelter-at-home orders and police-enforced quarantine zones.\n\n“So it seems to me that if we do a really good job, we’ll not only hold the death down to a level that is much lower than the other way had we not done a good job,” Mr. Trump said, “but people are talking about July, August, something like that.”",

Only about 62,000 full-featured ventilators were in hospitals across the country, a 2010 study found. More than 10,000 others are stored in the Strategic National Stockpile, a federal cache of supplies and medicines held in case of emergencies, according to Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nTens of thousands of other respiratory devices could be repurposed in an emergency, experts say, but the shortfall could be stark, potentially forcing doctors to make excruciating life-or-death decisions about who would get such help should hospitals become flooded with the desperately sick.\n\nMuch about the coronavirus remains unclear, and it is far from certain that the outbreak will reach severe proportions in the United States or affect many regions at once.

But in recent days, a group of contrarian political leaders, ethicists and ordinary Americans have bridled at what they saw as a tendency to dismiss the complex trade-offs that the measures collectively known as “social distancing” entail.\n\nBesides the financial ramifications of such policies, their concerns touch on how society’s most marginalized groups may fare and on the effect of government-enforced curfews on democratic ideals. Their questions about the current approach are distinct from those raised by some conservative activists who have suggested the virus is a politically inspired hoax, or no worse than the flu.\n\nEven in the face of a mounting coronavirus death toll, and the widespread adoption of the social distancing approach, these critics say it is important to acknowledge all the consequences of decisions intended to mitigate the virus’s spread.\n\nSome college students who were abruptly ushered off campus last week complain that they are more likely to infect higher-risk older adults at home than they were at college. Among the throngs who have been ordered to self-quarantine, some people question the purpose of isolating themselves if the virus is already circulating widely in their communities. Certain parents balk at the pressure from friends to withdraw their children from schools that are still open, or at what they see as groupthink that has prompted the cancellation of events that are still weeks or months away.\n\nAnd how do you weigh the risk of an unknown number of deaths against the possibility that several hundred thousand students who depend on free lunch at school will go hungry?

    "article_text": "President Trump doesn’t talk about his grandfather’s death, and he is hardly the only descendant of a victim of the 1918 pandemic who seems to be unaware of that part of his family history. Until recently, at least, the world had largely forgotten the 1918 flu pandemic, even though it took more American lives than World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War combined. There were few novels or films chronicling the experience then, and there have been few since. Most newspapers and radio stations were slow to report on it.\n\n“It’s really weird,” said Nancy K. Bristow, a history professor at the University of Puget Sound and the author of “American Pandemic: The Lost Worlds of the 1918 Influenza Epidemic.” “There was a complete silencing of that narrative of trauma. It feels so tragic because people’s lives were torn apart by this.”\n\nAmong those people were the family of Frederick Trump, whose death came early in the “curve,” at a time when no one fully realized that they were in the midst of a pandemic. New York’s close living quarters, its location as a shipping center, and its position as a hub for soldiers during World War I made it an ideal cesspool for the flu’s spread, but many doctors dismissed the early cases, often thinking that they were routine ailments; it was an era when deadly disease was a more common part of life. And yet, looking back, Frederick Trump’s death was a signature of that pandemic, which not only hit both the young and the old, but also many people like him, seemingly in their prime, healthy middle years.\n\nIt hit his son Fred — Donald Trump’s father — especially hard. It was “so immediate, he couldn’t take it in,” said Gwenda Blair, an adjunct professor at Columbia University and the author of “The Trumps: Three Generations of Builders and a President.” Ms. Blair interviewed Fred Trump about his father’s passing in 1991. She was among the few biographers to have had access to the family and to have investigated their genealogical history. “He was very matter of fact about it,” she said.\n\n“It just didn’t seem real,” Fred Trump told her. “‘I wasn’t that upset. You know how kids are. But I got upset watching my mother crying and being so sad. It was seeing her that made me feel bad, not my own feelings about what had happened.’” (Five days after Frederick Trump’s death, his brother in law, Fred Schuster, also died, likely of the flu as well, according to Ms. Blair.)",

    "article_text": "The mother-and-daughter pair, who are homeless, dependent on city transportation and have been staying temporarily with a relative, needed supplies before a shelter-in-place order that went into effect on Monday. They found wipes, but no diapers.\n\nThat evening, they returned to the hospital, but were sent home. Young was only two centimeters dilated, rather than the five to six centimeters that would indicate active labor.\n\nNothing seemed to be going right.\n\nThe plan had been for Young to be accompanied during childbirth by a community doula, funded by a grant through Sacramentos’s Black Child Legacy Campaign. But when Young’s doula, Joy Dean, drove them to another hospital — one of the few that accepts her Medi-Cal plan, California’s Medicaid program — the new limits on visitors permitted in labor and delivery departments in an attempt to contain the spread of Covid-19 meant that she was unable to accompany them inside.\n\n“I’m not worried about the virus. I’m worried about going back and they’re not listening to me,” said Young, adding that if Dean had been with her, they might have treated her differently.\n\nAs the United States struggles to respond to the Covid-19 crisis, tens of thousands of women across the country are giving birth in unprecedented circumstances. Hospitals are shifting their prenatal and postpartum care to telemedicine, limiting or outright banning visitors, offering elective inductions to full-term mothers and converting labor and delivery wards to coronavirus units.",

    "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/opinion/coronavirus-schools-closed.html",
    "article_text": "Based upon the assumption “that the number of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic cases is several times as high as the number of reported cases,” experts at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases are predicting that Covid-19’s case fatality rate may be considerably less than 1 percent. While that is higher than the rate for seasonal flu (0.1 percent), it’s much lower than the staggering rate we saw in the 1918 influenza pandemic (2.5 percent in the United States, and in some nations higher). It may even fall lower once we have a better sense of the number of mild cases. If this happens and most cases of Covid-19 turn out to be no worse than a nasty but not deadly bout of flu, NPIs like school closings won’t be necessary.\n\nBut this kind of data might not be available for analysis until Covid-19 has already spread widely. So for now, policies to contain it should be influenced by the adage “better safe than sorry.” There’s no room for the public to grouse about calls made too early.\n\nAfter all, it’s easy to reopen schools if the news is good. For example, my colleagues and I observed the use of school closings and other NPIs during the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic. During the first days of the outbreak in Mexico, the Health Ministry conducted a broad-based and exacting group of NPIs, similar to the ones we found worked in 1918. The measures appeared to contain the spread of influenza but were revoked 18 days later after it became clear that the H1N1 influenza virus was widespread but not all that deadly.\n\nOn the other hand, we studied the use of 559 school closings in Michigan during the fall wave of the 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic. Eighty-three percent of those closings occurred long after the virus had reached its peak week of infection and had already spread widely among people living in those school districts. The results were all too predictable: The late, reactive school closings had little effect on levels of influenza-like illnesses.\n\nThere’s no reason to close schools in communities that have not yet seen Covid-19. But that situation could change quickly, and when it does, school officials, public health agencies and municipal leaders will need to be ready to make the tough call of shutting the schools down. School officials should be checking C.D.C. guidance daily, if not hourly.",

    "article_text": "I think you know the answer to that question. It’s down. You know, it’s down. It’s been down for a month and a half. It’s going to go down more. This is not the bottom.\n\nHi, yes, we’re reporters. We’re asking how businesses are doing in Chinatown right now. You’re smiling.\n\nEverything is running slow. We’re doing half of what we’re used to doing this morning, 50% less than before. Easily 60%.\n\nNo, I’ve never seen it before. Never, never in my life. This is a serious epidemic.\n\nHave you ever seen it like this before?\n\nHere in New York City, business owners in Chinatown say sales are down because of widespread fear.\n\nWithin days it had expanded to the entire city by order of the government.\n\nAnd earlier today, Governor Andrew Cuomo explained the extraordinary measure that he is taking to protect New Yorkers and limit the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nLife as we know it for tourists and New Yorkers will be quite different for the time being.\n\nYeah. Today is still a little early, but 12:00, usually, the lunch crowd should be coming in. But now, see, we only have one person at one table. That’s an empty restaurant.\n\nI’m about to meet the owner of this restaurant, Amazing 66, and I am just getting to the front of the restaurant right now.\n\nSo this is Stella Tan. It’s Sunday, March 15, and I am in Manhattan’s Chinatown. There are some souvenir shops open, a few bakeries and restaurants open, but also a fair number of places are closed with their gates pulled down in front or with cardboard over their windows.\n\nMy name is Helen Ng, and I am the restaurant owner of Amazing 66 on Mott Street in Manhattan. I was actually born in Hong Kong, and I came over to United States with my family and four other siblings in 1969. I’m 12 years old at the time. My parents started working in the garment manufactory. I honestly say that I started working here underage the third day that I get to the United States. I go to school, and then I go to the garment manufactory to work after school.\n\nVery nice to meet you. Good luck. And I’ll definitely come back when it re-opens.\n\nThank you. I hope everybody can reopen to make Chinatown blossom again, you know, more people come back there. I just want to see the street that’s full of people instead of empty. That’s the most important. All right, well, nice meeting you.\n\nWell, I hope you can reopen and eat all those foods again soon with your staff and your family.\n\nFrom my restaurant? So many of them, you know? I have the pumpkin with the short rib. I have the chicken with garlic shallots. I have the lobster with cheese, and so many, so many.\n\nAnd what’s the food that you’re going to miss the most from your restaurant?\n\nIt’s sad, you know? I mean, as I told my staff, I say, they’re like a family to me. So if I don’t see them, I feel that I’m not home. But I hope this virus will go away soon and everybody be healthy.\n\nSince the business keeps going down and my staff is worried about the transportation when they’re traveling, I guess I have no choice but to decide to close up the restaurant as of tomorrow, the 16th. And of course I don’t really like it and I don’t want to, but I have no choice.\n\narchived recording\n\nWhile there are closures and cancellations throughout New York City, there are big crowds outside grocery stores. They are lined up around the block on the Upper West Side. The most challenging spot in any neighborhood right now — the grocery store. Regular shoppers rarely see this big a crowd here. Long lines of anxious shoppers have left shelves bare everywhere.\n\nalexandra leigh young\n\nOK, so this is Alex. It’s about 2:30 PM on a Sunday afternoon, and I’m standing in front of this market in my neighborhood called Halsey Traders Market, and it’s kind of like a cross between a small grocery store and what we call a bodega. It’s not a full-service grocery store, but you can come here to get a few toiletries, or some vegetables, whatever you need for the night. Yeah, I’m going to go in and I’m going to see what’s going on there. So I just walked in the front door, and there’s a lot of people here right now. So there’s about three little counters where people are checking out. Each one is pretty busy right now. There’s a line behind each one of them. I see this one woman right here at the counter. She’s buying a lot of cleaning products, like Lysol wipes and sprays. Hey. Are you JuJu? Nice to meet you. I’m not going to shake your hand, if that’s OK.\n\njuju\n\nI’m not going to shake your hand either.\n\nalexandra leigh young\n\nGreat, OK. Can I get you to just say your name and what you do here real quick?\n\njuju\n\nYeah, sure. My name is JuJu. I’ve been supervising this store and the Key Food down there for the past 10 years, and I’ve never seen anything like this. It’s just the sheer volume of customers shopping at the same time. You would think like perishable items wouldn’t be moving. I have no eggs. Yogurt is running out. Meat is running out.\n\nalexandra leigh young\n\nWhat did it feel like for you when you saw the line starting to get really crazy? What were you thinking in your head?\n\njuju\n\nI was nerve-wracked. I was extremely stressed. Like, yesterday I went so unprepared, bags under my eyes. I’m working 19 hours sometimes. Yeah, I’ll get like a half hour of sleep. My employees are overworked. I’m overworked. I’m shaking as I’m speaking to you now because I’m nervous.\n\nalexandra leigh young\n\nYour leg is shaking?\n\njuju\n\nI’m tired. I’m very tired. You know, I’m a cashier for five minutes, I’m stocking meat for five minutes. I’m doing everything. At one point in time there was a few shoplifters. I swear to God, I didn’t even have time talk to them. I was like — I tapped them on the shoulder, have a good day, enjoy.\n\nalexandra leigh young\n\nWhat were they stealing?\n\njuju\n\nSoap.\n\nalexandra leigh young\n\nSoap.\n\njuju\n\nWhat do you — if somebody is desperate enough to steal soap, what do you do? Have a good day, man. I don’t know if you see my eye twitching. I feel like my eye is twitching.\n\nalexandra leigh young\n\nCan’t tell.\n\njuju\n\nYou know, for the past 30 years, my family’s been around over here operating. My dad is 72 years old. When he comes around here, people recognize him. So you feel bad for people. You really want to help.\n\nspeaker\n\nHow you doing?\n\njuju\n\nWhat’s going on, brother? We have no garlic. We have no onion. We have no — our refrigerators are empty. Our walk-in boxes are empty. For as long as I know my entire life, Boar’s Head never delivers on Sunday. They don’t deliver on Saturday either. They close Saturday and Sunday.\n\nalexandra leigh young\n\nBoar’s Head is the lunch meat?\n\njuju\n\nYes, the delicatessen meats, and most popular in New York. And I called the guy yesterday and I was like, hey, listen, we don’t have anything. And the guy’s like, you know we don’t deliver on Sunday ever, right? I told him, I was like, look, if you have any common sense as a businessman, and if you have a heart, you’d get your ass up this morning, all right? And you deliver food, all right? Because people are running out. He called me this morning at 7:00 in the morning. He’s like, hey, I’m in front of the store. And he had a full truck. So he didn’t just come serve me. Boar’s Head is a really big company, but each route owner is independent. So that’s where I wanted to come from. This guy got up, left his family to do something like that. That’s something I appreciated a lot.\n\nalexandra leigh young\n\nWhen you said that you saw this line and you were nerve-wracked and you were panicked, what was the worst fear that was going through your head? Like, what were you specifically panicked about?\n\njuju\n\nThat people wouldn’t do what I was doing, the deep breaths, that people would start fighting each other, and that we would have to handle that. Like, where’s the support that we should have from our government, right? In that scenario, what am I supposed to do, put my own life in danger, or one of my guys?\n\nalexandra leigh young\n\nOver toilet paper or something.\n\njuju",

Gavin Newsom of California on Thursday ordered Californians — all 40 million of them — to stay in their houses as much as possible in the coming weeks as the state confronts the escalating coronavirus outbreak. The order represents the most drastic measure any governor has taken to control the virus, and a decision that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, which has far more cases than California, has resisted taking.\n\nMr. Newsom made the announcement from the state’s emergency operations center in Sacramento, normally a place where emergency workers coordinate responses to wildfires and earthquakes, and spoke in stark terms of the risk that the coronavirus posed to the population.\n\nCiting a model that state planners have been using, suggesting that 56 percent of Californians, or more than 25 million people, could be infected over eight weeks, Mr. Newsom said, “I think it’s time I tell you what I tell my family.”\n\n“This is not a permanent state, this is a moment in time,” he said. “We will look back at these decisions as pivotal.”",

He was in bed, recovering from something like a severe flu. (He had tested flu-negative, which was unusual — and what motivated her research.) They talked over email and WhatsApp and the phone about the grim situation evolving in Wuhan, China, where the virus originated.\n\n“In mid- to late January we started developing a plan for our family in case one of us became infected, and preparing supplies for two weeks of isolation,” she said. They also started calculating the numbers and sharing frustrations over their inability to convey to people the seriousness of the coronavirus’s exponential spread.\n\n“We were listening to people, such as President Trump, saying, ‘What’s the fuss, it’s just like the flu,’ and ‘There are only 15 cases, and only one death in the U.S., much fewer than everywhere else, we’re doing great,’” Dr. Nick Jewell said. “But every epidemiologist knew what was coming inexorably toward us.”",

Bars, restaurants and other gathering places were closed, and citizens were asked to avoid all unnecessary movement. Soon after, similar restrictions were extended countrywide.\n\nThe impact of those restrictions can be seen in pollution readings gathered by the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-5P satellite. The images show that emissions of nitrogen dioxide, a gas closely linked to vehicle exhaust, are considerably lower across northern Italy compared to the same time period last year. The region regularly struggles with wintertime smog.\n\nThe satellite data was analyzed for The New York Times by Descartes Labs, a geospatial analysis group.\n\nIn a separate analysis made public this weekend, researchers from Bocconi University reported a “sizeable” decline in several types of air pollution in Milan during the lockdown, including nitrogen dioxide levels and particulate matter pollution, a byproduct of burning fossil fuels that is highly damaging to human health.\n\n“It is clear people are not moving by cars,” said Dr. Percoco, an author on the study, noting that vehicle emissions are a major source of particulate matter and other pollution in Italian cities. Few people are on the streets, he said, with many Italians staying home to avoid the virus.\n\nMore NO 2 emissions December 2019 to March 2020 December 2018 to March 2019 Beijing Beijing South korea South korea Seoul Seoul Tokyo Tokyo Japan Japan China China Wuhan Wuhan More NO 2 emissions December 2019 to March 2020 December 2018 to March 2019 Beijing Beijing South korea South korea Seoul Seoul Tokyo Tokyo Japan Japan Wuhan Wuhan More NO 2 emissions Dec. 2018 to Mar. 2019 Dec. 2019 to Mar. 2020 Beijing Beijing Seoul Seoul Tokyo Tokyo China China Wuhan Wuhan Philippine Sea Philippine Sea More NO 2 emissions Decembeer 2019 to March 2020 Beijing South korea Seoul Tokyo Japan CHINA Wuhan Philippine Sea Decembeer 2018 to March 2019 Beijing South korea Seoul Tokyo Japan CHINA Wuhan Philippine Sea More NO 2 emissions Dec. 2019 to Mar. 2020 Beijing Seoul Tokyo CHINA Wuhan Philippine Sea Dec. 2018 to Mar. 2019 Beijing Seoul Tokyo CHINA Wuhan Philippine Sea\n\nChina and South Korea\n\nThe drop in pollution was even starker in China, where the new coronavirus was first detected. The largest emissions reductions were seen surrounding the city of Wuhan, in Hubei Province.\n\nChinese officials put the region on lockdown in late January, following the Chinese New Year holiday, and have only recently begun relaxing restrictions to allow workers in key industries to return to their jobs. That includes public transportation workers and those involved in making medical supplies and other necessities.\n\nThe unprecedented lockdown, which barred the movement of nearly 35 million people, caused widespread economic disruptions, including a slowdown in manufacturing and electricity generation.\n\nPollution across the region plunged accordingly.\n\n“What we saw in China was a very rapid effect,” said Joanna Joiner, an atmospheric physicist at NASA. The agency’s own analysis found that nitrogen dioxide emissions over eastern and central China were significantly lower during January and February this year compared to what is normal for the period.\n\nEvery year, pollution dips across the country during the weeklong Lunar New Year celebration, as factories shut down and people stay home from work. (The holiday falls in late January or early February each year). But usually, emissions rebound as the country reopens for business. This year, they stayed at lower levels for weeks.\n\nA smaller decrease in nitrogen dioxide pollution can also be seen in South Korea, around the capital, Seoul. The South Korean government did not bar the movement of its citizens but encouraged strict social distancing by closing down schools and universities, asking people to work from home and canceling large gatherings.\n\nThe social distancing measures, as well as an increasing number of people in self-quarantine, appear to have had an impact on air pollution, said Minwoo Son, a coordinator at the Global Air Pollution Unit of Greenpeace East Asia. But further analysis is needed to fully understand the depth of coronavirus’ impact on South Korea’s air, he added.\n\nAs more countries shut down life as usual to slow the spread of coronavirus, we may see further drops in pollution around the world, Dr. Joiner said.\n\n“We’re seeing changes in human behavior, in how people are moving around and how they’re using fuels,” she said. “Pollution won’t hide from the satellite data. It’s going to tell us what’s going on.”",

Fifteen of them have died, mostly residents of a nearby nursing home devastated by the illness and half the nation’s death toll.\n\nWhile much of the country is just starting to see clusters of cases emerge, the hospital east of Seattle offers a window into the challenges set to cascade through the nation’s health care system, testing the resilience of workers, the readiness of institutions and the flexibility of supply chains.\n\nThe past few weeks have seen medical workers operating at the very edges of their capabilities, facing a virus so virulent that some patients were dying within hours of coming down with their first symptoms.\n\nCaregivers who had been sent home into quarantine had to be called back to work to face the overwhelming task at hand. Engineers spent late nights scrambling to overhaul rooms so that contaminated air could not escape. Sanitation and janitorial crews struggled to swab down rooms where even a trace of the virus could infect the next patient. Supplies were so strained that nurses turned to menstrual pads to buttress the padding in their helmets.",

And I love playing violin. OK, I’m going to have to stand up for this. A lot of things are really happening right now, like Covid-19. [Violin playing] I’ve heard that it is a very contagious virus. And when people get it, a lot of people have to go to the hospital. But some of them have to get isolated. It’s changed my life because now, we don’t get to go in school. My teacher told us that she didn’t know if it was going to close for the whole year. Ta-da.” “You’ve got blanky fuzz in your hair. Right now, me and Allia are actually living in a family shelter.” “I don’t like the way you brush it. You brush it so hard. Basically, it’s one room with a bathroom, and then one bed and a bunk bed. I guess, it’s now my classroom, too.” “I got contacted by her school to go pick up her iPad device. And her iPad does not have internet. The shelter that we’re in, they do not allow internet. What classroom stuff are we going to do today? Math?” “Well, science is already too hard. It keeps on pausing itself, just freezing.” “Oh OK, I will look into that in a little bit.” “Across the room.” “And see what’s going on. I have a cellphone. We use the hot spot. I don’t have a lot of data. And it’s a little spotty and slow. Essentially, that’s just where we’ve been is puttering outside to get a better signal, hoping it gets better.” “A school has 17 tables in the cafeteria. Each table has 12 seats.” “I am worried that children are going to get left behind because they don’t have their devices or they didn’t have the access to the internet. Let’s try that one again.” “So we’ll probably have to redo our whole grade, and relearn everything we already know.” “Right now, my biggest worry for Allia would be the social interaction. My mother, who’s disabled, and her service animal lives with us. So we’re all in this really tiny space.” “Yeah. I’m worried about that because my grandmother, she is really old. And if she gets it or if my mother gets sick, they could get hurt. And if they both get it, who’s going to take care of me that day? And then if we’re all locked in the same room, how are we going to be safe?”",

We kept our suitcases packed and lying around the house, just in case we had to get to the hospital quickly. When I look at what seems like the world’s version of my very personal journey with health anxiety, I feel acknowledged in a way that I have not experienced before. Packing bags in case you need to make an urgent run to the hospital is kind of like stocking up a freezer full of what my roommate deems her “coronafood.”\n\nBut years of living with transplant complications, including a compromised immune system, have taught me how to live despite this fear, how to navigate a world rife with potential danger at every turn. Trust me, in a strange effort to keep healthier people calm, my credibility and need for vigilance is made clear by news anchors feeding us updates: If you are currently living without an illness or disability, my risk of dying from the coronavirus is higher than yours.\n\nMy coronavirus advice, I should say, is also my greater life advice.\n\nYears ago, when my doctor told me I might need to be put on the organ list for a third transplant, I responded by leaving town the next day for a summer internship in New York. I was not being reckless. I did this only after scheduling a visit to meet a local doctor who could take care of me, if the need should arise. In the days of the coronavirus, I take the subway to and home from work, but I also diligently wash my hands afterward. Don’t alter your life in dramatic ways, but do make sure that the risks you take are calculated ones. Be social, but don’t hang around sick people. Get your haircut, but don’t touch your face. Go out to dinner, but don’t share food.\n\nThroughout an average day in New York, I share space with hundreds of other people, all of whom I have no control over. Should a friend come to my apartment, should I go on a date that ends with a kiss, should I see Billie Eilish perform when she comes to town, I will lack control over my exposure to the virus. To respond to this reality, l do what I normally do: make my calculations and ensure that my risks are minimal, and then let it be. Because here’s the thing: the life that I’m working so hard to protect is not really a life at all if it is consumed by fear.\n\nI’m not saying I’m not afraid or that you shouldn’t be. My fear is my constant companion, but I can manage it alongside my desire to live a full life. I can channel this fear into a boldness for the other things that scare me. Growing up with an uncertain future, I was able to achieve some of my wildest goals: giving a TED Talk, starting a nonprofit and creating a summit to empower young women. Befriending my fear is my superpower, and it turns out, that I’m not alone here either.",

It will be some time before public health officials determine how many people at the hospital end up being infected.\n\nRegardless, better understanding of what happened over Mr. Garbuz’s four days at Lawrence, which has about 290 beds, could help other hospitals more quickly make diagnoses in the future. It could provide insight into how hospitals might limit the number of people exposed to each patient. In the larger picture, it may help contain the spread of an outbreak.\n\n“He is a very caring hardworking person who constantly cares for his clients and those around him over himself,” Adina Lewis Garbuz, Mr. Garbuz’s wife, said about him on Facebook.

    "article_text": "The new figures from China’s Health Commission on Wednesday showed that 65 people died on Tuesday and that 3,887 more people had been infected. So far, 24,324 people have been infected.\n\nHealth experts say the death toll is likely to rise because of the large number of infections. The mortality rate of the coronavirus, about 2 percent so far, appears to be far lower than SARS, which has a mortality rate of about 10 percent.\n\nExperts warn they still lack full data to say definitively how lethal the new coronavirus is. Many residents in Wuhan believe the death toll is much higher than the official tally because people with flulike symptoms are being turned away by overstretched hospitals. The health care system there is so overwhelmed that many cases are not diagnosed because of a shortage of testing kits.\n\nThe number of people recovering from the virus is also rising, suggesting that the treatment plan is working. On Tuesday, 262 people left the hospitals. The number of new suspected cases has dropped for two days in a row. Officials said they were tracking 3,971 new suspected cases, compared with 5,173 cases the day before.\n\nOn Tuesday, health officials released details of the deaths so far, saying that two-thirds of them were men. More than 80 percent were over 60 years old, and they typically had pre-existing health conditions such as cardiovascular diseases or diabetes.",

If you had only one ventilator, it would go to someone more likely to survive instead of someone deemed unlikely to do so. It would not go to whichever patient was first admitted, and it would not be assigned via a lottery system.

    "article_text": "Hover over the bubbles to explore each profession, including how many people work in those jobs and what they earn.\n\nWorkers in a number of professions facing elevated risk earn less than the national median wage. Many of these workers in low-paying jobs do not have paid sick leave, and many could still go to work sick to not lose income.\n\nThe risk isn’t limited to those on the front lines. Many people who do service jobs like cashiers and fast-food workers face elevated risks. Walmart, Starbucks and Uber are among the many companies that have had workers fall sick.\n\nSchool systems around the country have been closing. Teachers rate high both for exposure to illnesses and for their proximity to other people.\n\nFirst responders are also at high risk. Firefighters who responded to calls at the Washington nursing home are under extended quarantines . Paramedics across the country are taking extra precautions when responding to a possible coronavirus case.\n\nPersonal care aides and home health aides who work with the elderly — the population most susceptible to the illness — are also vulnerable. At a nursing home in Washington State linked to 25 coronavirus deaths as of Saturday, at least 70 employees have fallen sick .\n\nHealth care workers are at the greatest risk — they can encounter diseases and infections daily and typically work in close proximity to one another and their patients. Many are already under quarantine because of exposure to the virus.\n\nThe vertical position of each bubble is a measure of how often workers in a given profession are exposed to disease and infection .\n\nEach bubble on this chart represents an occupation. The bigger the bubble, the more people do that job.\n\nAs the coronavirus continues to spread throughout the United States, people with jobs that put them in physical contact with many others are at the greatest risk of becoming sick.\n\nThe risk levels of various jobs were calculated using O*NET, a database maintained by the Department of Labor that describes various physical aspects of different occupations. The database assigns dozens of scores to each occupation for things like how often a telephone is used to how often a job requires you to bend your body. (Housekeepers rank highest in this metric.)\n\nAs virus cases have grown, many businesses have begun closing offices and stores, and sending workers home to help slow the spread. While many companies have emergency leave policies in place to help protect their employees, there are large portions of the population that have few protections. On Saturday, legislators passed a relief package that includes paid sick leave for workers affected by the coronavirus. But the benefits only apply to employees of companies with fewer than 500 employees, leaving millions of workers uncovered.\n\nPercent of workers with access to paid leave benefits Group Sick leave Personal leave All workers 74% 45% Nurses 92% 68% Teachers 86% 62% Service industry workers 56% 28% Sales workers 65% 40% Full-time workers 85% 54% Part-time workers 40% 18% Top 25 percent of earners 92% 63% Bottom 25 percent of earners 47% 24% Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics Employee Benefits Survey\n\nFor some workers — especially those in low-paying jobs — being furloughed could mean layoffs. In the Seattle area, one small catering company was forced to let go nearly all its employees because of cancellations from big tech clients.\n\nA growing number of companies have also been asking employees to do their jobs from home. But that arrangement is largely available only to white-collar workers. For many occupations, working from home is simply not feasible, including those who are on the front lines of the response and those who are on the lower end of the economic scale.",

    "article_text": "Milan, Italy. Daegu, South Korea. Qom, Iran. Many of the world’s largest coronavirus outbreaks took root in and around well-traveled cities, but they have since grown to encompass entire countries.\n\nCases have spread across Italy’s north and down to Rome, leading to a lockdown of the entire country. Iran’s capital, where leaders dismissed the virus just two weeks ago, has seen thousands infected. And cases continue to surge across Europe.\n\nNew cases in past week Total cases Cases per 100k residents Italy 24,122 27,980 45 Iran 11,478 14,991 18 Spain 7,494 7,753 16 France 6,253 6,633 10 Germany 5,530 6,012 8 South Korea 1,781 7,869 16 Sources: Local governments; The Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University; CIA World Factbook. Data as of 4:59 p.m. E.T., Mar. 16.\n\nThe outbreaks are not all heading in the same direction. South Korea has managed to slow growth of new cases for now, through intensive testing and monitoring of infections. Italy, Iran and the United States are still reporting large numbers of new cases every day.\n\nOfficial case totals are an imperfect method of judging the world’s outbreaks. Every country has more cases than it has been able to detect through lab tests. And a shortage of testing kits in some countries, like Indonesia and the United States, along with a lack of public disclosure in others, like Egypt, means official reports are probably masking large outbreaks.\n\nHere’s the extent of some of the largest outbreaks in the world and information on how these countries are trying to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nItaly\n\nAn outbreak in Lombardy has threatened the entire country.\n\nLodi 1,135+ AUSTRIA HUNGARY Bergamo 2,365+ SWITZERLAND Milan 1,305+ LOMBARDY SLOVENIA Brescia 1,780+ SERBIA CROATIA FRANCE Venice 245+ 300+ Padua 520+ 480+ BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA 250+ 515+ 360+ 495+ Piacenza 705+ Florence 100+ 155+ Ancona ITALY Cremona 1,340+ ITALY Rome 215+ Bari ITALY Naples 135+ 50 MILES Catania Lodi 1,135+ AUSTRIA Milan 1,305+ HUNGARY Bergamo 2,365+ SWITZERLAND LOMBARDY SLOVENIA Brescia 1,780+ CROATIA Venice 245+ 300+ Padua 520+ BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA 480+ 515+ 360+ 495+ Piacenza 705+ Florence 100+ 155+ Cremona 1,340+ ITALY Rome 215+ Naples 315+ 50 MILES Lodi 1,135+ AUSTRIA Bergamo 2,365 HUNGARY SWITZERLAND Milan 1,305+ LOMBARDY SLOVENIA Brescia 1,780 CROATIA Venice 245+ 300+ BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA 480+ 515+ 360+ 495+ Piacenza 705+ 155+ Cremona 1,340+ ITALY Rome 215+ Naples 135+ 50 MILES Lodi 1,135+ AUSTRIA Milan 1,305+ Bergamo 2,365 HUNGARY LOMBARDY SLOVENIA Brescia 1,780+ CROATIA Venice 245+ 300+ BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA 360+ 495+ Florence 100+ Piacenza 705+ ITALY Cremona 1,340+ Rome 215+ Naples 135+ 50 MILES By The New York Times | Source: Italy Department of Civil Protection | Note: Data shows total number of cases as of March 13.\n\nWith more than 17,000 confirmed cases, Italy has reported the largest outbreak outside of China. Italian authorities first put restrictions in place in the northern region of Lombardy, where the outbreak first accelerated, before moving on Monday to restrict the movement and end public gatherings for all 60 million citizens in the country. At least 1,000 people have died because of the virus.\n\nOn Wednesday, the government shut down basically all commercial activities, including bars and restaurants. Supermarkets, pharmacies and newstands can remain open. All schools are closed until at least April 3. But Italy’s nationwide lockdown, the first in Europe, is not a severe ban on movement like the one put in place in Wuhan, China. Italians are still able to move around for work, to buy groceries and other essentials, and for reasons having to do with health, child or senior care. Police checkpoints have been set up around the country, at which people are required to stop and fill out official forms explaining their movements.\n\nThe number of new cases in Italy had steadily increased for more than a week before dropping on Tuesday. On that day, though, there were still almost 1,000 new cases.\n\nNew coronavirus cases announced in Italy each day 0 500 1,000 1,500 cases Jan. 22 Mar. 10 By The New York Times | Source: Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nItaly is aggressively testing for the virus, which could help explain why its total confirmed cases are higher than some other countries in Europe. On Tuesday, more than 60,000 tests had been performed, more than twice as many tests as the United Kingdom had done.\n\n“Today, the red zone is Italy,” Matteo Renzi, a former prime minister, told The New York Times. But in 10 days, he warned, it will be Madrid, Paris and Berlin. If Italy cannot show how to stop the virus, he said, “the red zone will be Europe.”\n\nSouth Korea\n\nThe outbreak has slowed after weeks of intense surveillance and testing.\n\nNORTH KOREA Seoul 220+ Incheon 25+ Chungnam province 110+ SOUTH KOREA Gyeongbuk province 1,145+ Daegu 5,900+ Gyeongnam province 80+ Busan 95+ 50 MILES JAPAN NORTH KOREA Seoul 220+ Incheon 25+ Chungnam province 110+ SOUTH KOREA Gyeongbuk province 1,145+ Daegu 5,900+ Gyeongnam province 80+ Busan 95+ 50 MILES NORTH KOREA Incheon 25+ Seoul 220+ Chungnam province 110+ SOUTH KOREA Gyeongbuk province 1,145+ Daegu 5,900+ Gyeongnam province 80+ Busan 95+ 50 MILES NORTH KOREA Seoul 220+ Incheon 25+ Chungnam province 110+ SOUTH KOREA Gyeongbuk province 1,145+ Daegu 5,900+ Gyeongnam province 80+ Busan 95+ JAPAN 50 MILES By The New York Times | Source: South Korea Division of Risk Assessment and International Cooperation | Note: Data shows total number of cases as of March 13.\n\nIn contrast to most other countries, South Korea’s reports of new cases have begun to slow — at least for now. Unlike other countries with major outbreaks, South Korea, with a population of 50 million, has not outright restricted the movement of its citizens and has instead focused on aggressively monitoring for infections. More than 7,900 cases and 66 deaths have been reported.\n\nNew coronavirus cases announced in South Korea each day 0 500 1,000 1,500 cases Jan. 22 Mar. 10 By The New York Times | Source: Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nMore than 235,000 people have been tested, and health officials carefully track down people who may have symptoms, testing more than 10,000 people each day. The government even opened drive-through testing centers. While health officials are battling smaller clusters of infections in other cities, much of the effort has focused on Daegu, the center of the outbreak, where many people were infected in a large church congregation.\n\nHealth officials also introduced aggressive public awareness campaigns, sending out mobile phone alerts to citizens whenever a new case is reported in their districts. Updates are provided on government websites and mobile apps as to how many people have been tested and where, along with brief sketches on each patient: their gender, how they became infected and where they are being treated, as well as which places they visited before testing positive.\n\nOfficials have advised against holding large gatherings, like outdoor rallies and religious services.

Data shows total number of cases as of March 13.\n\nTwo weeks ago, Iran’s leaders denied the coronavirus epidemic would be a problem. Now, with the total number of cases standing at more than 11,000, and with more than 400 people dead, Iran is scrambling to control one of the worst outbreaks in the world.\n\nThe virus started in the holy city of Qom, where thousands of pilgrims from Iran and around the Middle East travel each day. Two days after the first deaths and cases of the virus were reported in Qom, Iran held parliamentary elections, which are widely believed to have been the cause of the virus spreading to other provinces.\n\nNew coronavirus cases announced in Iran each day 0 500 1,000 1,500 cases Jan. 22 Mar. 10 By The New York Times | Source: Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThe authorities failed to take protective measures at this early stage. But the problem became impossible to ignore after nearly three dozen Iranian government officials and members of parliament were infected, and a senior adviser to the supreme leader died.\n\nNow, Friday prayers are cancelled, and schools and universities are closed until mid-April. Government offices remain open, but employees must work reduced hours. For everyone else, officials are asking people to leave their homes only when necessary.\n\nA severe shortage of testing kits in Iran means the spread of the virus is likely much higher than reported. One study projected a week ago that the true total of infections may have been more than 18,000, “and a week ago is eons when we are talking about an epidemic,” said Isaac Bogoch, a Toronto doctor who is a co-author of that study.\n\nSee our maps tracking the coronavirus outbreak around the world.\n\nSee our page of maps, charts and tables tracking every coronavirus case in the U.S.",

    "article_text": "Mayor Bill de Blasio, speaking at a news briefing later on Wednesday, went further, calling the deal “immoral.” Mr. de Blasio said New York City would be getting only $1 billion, despite having one-third of the country’s virus cases. He said he planned to appeal directly to President Trump, a native New Yorker, to “fix this situation.”\n\n“It should have been one of the easiest no-brainers in the world for the U.S. Senate to include real money for New York City and New York State in this stimulus bill, and yet it didn’t happen,” Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said, putting the blame on Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader.\n\nMayor debunks the idea of returning to normal in April.\n\nMr. de Blasio continued to emphasize on Wednesday how urgently the city needed supplies to cope with the crush of new cases. He said he appreciated the assistance the federal government had committed to providing, but that more was required. And he again called for the U.S. military to get more directly involved and in a much bigger way.\n\nThe mayor warned New Yorkers to relinquish any hope of a return to normal life by April, rejecting the president’s comments this week that he wanted the economy to reopen by Easter. City residents should prepare for the possibility that conditions could worsen in May, he said.\n\nCiting various projections, the mayor said at least half of all New Yorkers could contract the virus, an estimate similar to those that officials have given in California. But Mr. de Blasio noted that for 80 percent of those who were infected, it would be “a very limited experience.”",

    "article_text": "Mr. President, very simple question. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your response to this crisis? [FLASHBACK SOUND EFFECT] The risk to the American people remains very low. This is an unprecedented potential severe health challenge. It’ll go away. Goes away. It’s going. away. We will see more cases and things will get worse than they are right now. In April, supposedly, it dies with the hotter weather. This virus is probably with us beyond this season, or beyond this year. This is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. Have you been briefed by the CDC? I have. Are there words about a pandemic at this point? No, not at all, and we have it totally under control. When you have 15 people and the 15, within a couple of days, is going to be down to close to zero. And we can expect to see more cases in the United States. We will see more cases. Unfortunately, we are likely to see more deaths. I like the numbers being where they are. I don’t need to have the numbers double. We’ll certainly have tens of thousands of cases in the US. Hopefully, we won’t hit hundreds of thousands of cases. We’d much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it, and that’s what we are. You are always behind where you think you are. If you think you’re here, you’re really here. Anybody that wants a test can get a test. Not everybody, tomorrow, is going to be able to get a test. Anybody that needs a test. That’s the important thing. And the tests are all perfect. The idea of anybody getting it easily, the way people in other country are doing it, we’re not set up for that. That is a failing. A failing? Yes. It is a failing, let’s admit it. Dr. Fauci said that the lag in testing was in fact a failing. Do you take responsibility for that? Yeah. No, I don’t take responsibility at all. They’re gonna have vaccines, I think, relatively soon. And they’re going to have— [CHEERING] something that makes you better. It would take them about a year to a year and a half to be fully confident that we would have a vaccine that would be able to protect the American people. I mean, I like the sound of a couple of months better, I must be honest. Is it safe or appropriate to be holding rallies during a public health crisis like this? I think it’s very safe. Yeah. You probably shouldn’t get on planes. You shouldn’t go into areas, large malls, large areas where people are congregating because it’s too high a risk. Getting away from shaking hands is a good thing. Maybe people shouldn’t be shaking hands for the long term because it does transmit flu and other things. I’m working on getting the boss to do this. I may not be successful, but we’re working on it. In terms of deaths, I don’t what the count is today. Is it 11? 11 people. What is the number as of this morning? Is it 32? You could tell me, is it 32 deaths, Steve? Unfortunately, one person passed away overnight. She was a wonderful woman, a medically high-risk patient in her late 50s. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your response to this crisis? I’d rate it a 10. I think we’ve done a great job.",

And when she checked Amazon, she couldn’t find it for less than $50.\n\n“You’re being selfish, hoarding resources for your own personal gain,” she said of the sellers.\n\nSites like Amazon and eBay have given rise to a growing industry of independent sellers who snatch up discounted or hard-to-find items in stores to post online and sell around the world.\n\nThese sellers call it retail arbitrage, a 21st-century career that has adults buying up everything from limited-run cereals to Fingerling Monkeys, a once hot toy. The bargain hunters look for anything they can sell at a sharp markup. In recent weeks, they found perhaps their biggest opportunity: a pandemic.\n\nAs they watched the list of Amazon’s most popular searches crowd with terms like “Purell,” “N95 mask” and “Clorox wipes,” sellers said, they did what they had learned to do: Suck up supply and sell it for what the market would bear.\n\nInitially, the strategy worked. For several weeks, prices soared for some of the top results to searches for sanitizer, masks and wipes on Amazon, according to a New York Times analysis of historical prices from Jungle Scout, which tracks data for Amazon sellers. The data shows that both Amazon and third-party sellers like Mr. Colvin increased their prices, which then mostly dropped when Amazon took action against price gouging this month.",

They describe managers who seem to not care about their plight.\n\n“But we show up and have to keep showing up,” one nurse wrote, “and we have to test ourselves.”\n\nThe document was created on March 19 by Sonja Schwartzbach, a nurse in New Jersey who is studying as a doctoral student. She said she had started compiling the accounts after she determined that hospital conditions were “far worse” than most people realized and that her fellow health care workers needed a place to share what they were seeing.\n\n“There was such desperation,” she said in an interview. “And it wasn’t being adequately addressed in the news media.”",

And I was just coughing a ton.” “I had a headache and felt feverish.” “It felt like I had a bowling ball on my chest. Nobody’s willing to see me, and nobody has the test kit and even C.D.C. is refusing to test me.” “I traced back, you know, my wife, she works at Amazon. They had a confirmed case.” “Four different planes in four different airports. So I don’t know who sat next to me or who I was in contact with.” “It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.” “We’re going down, not up. We’re going very substantially down. Not up.” “Anybody that needs a test, gets a test. They’re there. They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful.” “We have a president saying anyone who wants tests can get a test. And I’m thinking, That is so not true.” “It was just interesting, because there was this kind of gray area for a while of people who felt like they were really sick and should have been tested just as, even as a rule out. And the state of Washington just did not have the capacity to do that, because the government had not supported us at that point essentially.” “I got through to public health after about an hour, and they told me that I did not meet the criteria for being tested.” “They said, ‘There’s no way to get tested. We don’t have tests right now. There’s nothing set up in Delaware.’” “I looked at the C.D.C. website and it said, call your doctor if you have the symptoms. So I called the doctor’s office and they told me to go to an urgent care facility. I called an urgent care facility and they said that there’s nothing that they can do. And they don’t have the tests. And they told me to go to the E.R. And I called a hospital, and they told me that they don’t have the test either.” “I just felt like I was getting the run-around. It was clearly obvious that they just are under capacity, and they’re not able to test.” “I eventually just gave up because, at that point, the testing criteria was so strict. It was, you travel to China or have you been in contact with someone known diagnosed Covid. And I didn’t meet any of that.” “As a nurse in an E.R., it’s pretty vital if I have an infectious disease that I know what it is because I could be spreading it to people who are really vulnerable.” “I actually work in a building that’s a fairly public place. There’s people of every generation coming in there. There’s a private school there. There’s a senior center.” “Southwest Florida is full of elders. There is a lot of snowbirds coming here. They’re all in their 70s and 80s. I cannot get myself, like I cannot convince my conscience to leave the house just thinking about that, Hey you went grocery shopping and now like five people died. So I just self quarantined myself and basically started working from home.” “We stocked up on food items as much as possible. I bought a 25 pound bag of rice. We bought beans. We got ready basically just to hunker down for those two weeks. At this point, I’m telling people like make — if you have a decision to make, think about survival and make the decision based on survival for yourself, your family and your community.” “We knew this was coming. The federal government is just completely bungling this, and our lives are at stake. I feel like they’re just leaving us here to die in Seattle.” “The most overwhelming feeling was you are on your own.” “I’m just really concerned for those that this is going to affect the hardest. And I think we pretty much failed at early testing, early containment. We had more time than other governments.”",

    "article_text": "Some disasters, like hurricanes and earthquakes, can bring people together, but if history is any judge, pandemics generally drive them apart. These are crises in which social distancing is a virtue. Dread overwhelms the normal bonds of human affection.\n\nIn “The Decameron,” Giovanni Boccaccio writes about what happened during the plague that hit Florence in 1348: “Tedious were it to recount how citizen avoided citizen, how among neighbors was scarce found any that shewed fellow-feeling for another, how kinfolk held aloof, and never met … nay, what is more, and scarcely to be believed, fathers and mothers were found to abandon their own children, untended, unvisited, to their fate.”\n\nIn his book on the 1665 London epidemic, “A Journal of the Plague Year,” Daniel Defoe reports, “This was a time when every one’s private safety lay so near them they had no room to pity the distresses of others. … The danger of immediate death to ourselves, took away all bonds of love, all concern for one another.”\n\nFear drives people in these moments, but so does shame, caused by the brutal things that have to be done to slow the spread of the disease. In all pandemics people are forced to make the decisions that doctors in Italy are now forced to make — withholding care from some of those who are suffering and leaving them to their fate.",

    "article_text": "michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”\n\n[music]\n\nToday: A suburb north of New York City has become one of the largest clusters of the coronavirus in the U.S. My colleague, Sarah Maslin Nir, went there. It’s Thursday, March 19.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSarah, tell us about the past few weeks in this town of New Rochelle, New York.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIt began with a local man. His name is Larry Garbuz. He’s a lawyer. He’s about 50, lives in New Rochelle, which is this suburb about five or so miles north of New York City’s border. And he falls ill about February 27, and he starts to decline pretty rapidly. He asks a neighbor to drive him to the hospital and spends several days there really spiraling. Then on March 2, they find out what was wrong with Larry Garbuz, and it was coronavirus.\n\n[music]\n\narchived recording Cases of coronavirus are growing nationwide, and New York state is no exception.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nHe’s the first person in this suburb that is diagnosed.\n\narchived recording Investigators scrambling to retrace the patient’s movements from the Bronxville hospital where he was first treated.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd disease investigators then have to trace his movements.\n\narchived recording The week before he knew he was contagious, the married father of four traveled around the New York City area. He also attended temple services back in Westchester.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd found out that he had attended religious services, just as anyone would — a wedding, a bar mitzvah — about a week before.\n\narchived recording Synagogue Young Israel of New Rochelle ordered to close, and hundreds of people who attended services there have been told to quarantine themselves at home.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd the Westchester County Health Department ordered a hundred families, congregants at that synagogue, to self-quarantine.\n\n[music]\n\nSo I’m sitting in our offices at Times Square when we hear about this diagnosis, and I immediately get in my car and head up to New Rochelle. Because this is going to have huge ripple effects in his town. We know it. And when I arrived, people didn’t even know it had happened. There was a man pushing at the door of Young Israel, Mr. Garbuz’s synagogue, trying to get in for evening prayers, not understanding why it was locked. There were restaurants, where people should be turning up for evening hours, not understanding why their customers were calling in takeout instead. This was a town where the news that they were part of this global pandemic was just settling in.\n\nspeaker But there’s nothing we can do about it. I think it’s another flu that’s going to go away, hopefully. sarah maslin nir Mm-hmm.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nPeople were barely understanding that this had happened to them.\n\nspeaker And I’m still going to go out. I’m going to go to CVS, the post office, the bank, because — I’m going to wash my hands. I’m going to try never to ever touch my face. I’m going to live my life.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo to the degree that something is happening here in New Rochelle, it’s dawning on people very slowly.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI think it’s dawning on America very slowly, and New Rochelle was a reflection of the lack of seriousness with which the country was taking this threat.\n\n[music]\n\nBut from that quiet first evening in New Rochelle, things rapidly began to change.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) Good afternoon. New Rochelle is a particular problem.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd on March 10, something unprecedented happens.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) What we are going to do is focus on an area, a concentric circle around —\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nA one-mile radius containment zone is designated in New Rochelle, surrounding the neighborhood of this first patient.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) Facilities within that area, schools within that area would be closed for two weeks. We’ll go in, we’ll clean the schools and assess the situation. This can’t be a political decision. This is a public health decision.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nThat containment zone is the red hot center of New York’s coronavirus outbreak.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) We’re also going to use the National Guard in the containment area.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd then, in comes the National Guard.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) It is a dramatic action, but it is the largest cluster in the country. And this is literally a matter of life and death. That’s not an overly rhetorical statement.\n\n[music]\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nYou have people holed up in their homes, people needing testing, needing health care, needing the basic necessities of life and affected by this virus that dramatically curtails their movements. I wanted to understand, how is the government keeping us safe? How are the health care workers carrying out testing? And how are the people of New Rochelle coping?\n\nsarah maslin nir I’m standing on Lincoln Avenue, which is just outside the containment zone in New Rochelle, where a huge truck full of hundreds and thousands of pounds of food has just arrived. About six uniformed members of the National Guard are standing outside this truck as a pallet is unloaded full of —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Sarah, why exactly is the National Guard there? What is their official mission? When I think the National Guard being dispatched, it’s usually after a natural disaster and they are literally there to pick up the pieces.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nYeah. These men and women had been to floods. They’d been to earthquakes. They’d been to hurricane zones. This is the first-ever time they were called to an epidemic event.\n\nmember of the national guard So we’re basically responding to all natural disasters in New York state —\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd they were called here for two main purposes, which is to deliver meals to people bound in their homes by quarantine, and to clean.\n\nsarah maslin nir So I’ve just walked into the Jewish Community Center on Wilmot Road in Scarsdale. Inside, 60 members of the National Guard are doing a deep clean.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI watched them clean at a community center, and the meticulousness was really incredible.\n\nmember of the national guard I’m currently going to inform the process of sanitizing the equipment. First, you have to take the equipment and put it into the solution of water and bleach.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI walk into a classroom for children, and there are these men and women squeezed in their military gear into teeny, tiny plastic seats for toddlers, poring over piles of building blocks and Legos and scrubbing each block by hand.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe National Guard is scrubbing children’s toys?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nYeah, it was an uncanny sight. They did this kind of thing throughout the containment zone — cleaning synagogues, city facilities, community centers, scrubbing ceilings, floors, chairs, anything that a sick person may have touched.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, Sarah, as you’re describing this, the National Guard is on the ground. Local officials are still theoretically in charge. Right? Like the people who run the city, probably even the county. So is it clear to you who is in charge, and is this all coordinated?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIn the early moments of New Rochelle coming to terms with this new reality, it was a lot of moving pieces. It was a city in turmoil with no real leadership structure in place at that moment. But I get in my car, and I drive down to downtown New Rochelle to the headquarters of the Westchester County Health Department and discover that something had been building here all along.\n\nsarah maslin nir I’m standing inside of the incident response center in New Rochelle, and there’s a group of about 30 nurses on folding chairs getting a briefing about their deployment to test people who are quarantined at home. speaker Make sure go to the bathroom. Wash your hands properly before you do anything. Take breaks. You don’t have to rush around. We want to make sure that you are taking care of each other and —\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd there I come upon a huge, bustling incident command center.\n\nsarah maslin nir They’re going out in groups of three, in protective gear with swab kits.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is there. The room is filled with nurses. There is an assembly line of test gear, and test kits, and what’s called P.P.E. — personal protective equipment. People are filing around the room equipping themselves to get ready to deploy to the houses of sick people to test them for coronavirus.\n\nsarah maslin nir And they’re all asking lots of very understandable questions. nurse Is there going to be an influx of testing, or it’s just, like, we’re only doing New Rochelle? sarah maslin nir How do we make sure these people feel safe? How do we make sure that we’re safe as we go out onto the front lines?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nSo at this point, in the United States only 25,000 people had been tested for coronavirus. And this command center is to send that number way up. So people will call into their doctors, tell their symptoms. They’ll get put on a list. And every so often, these groups of nurses were getting an address, information. They’d put on head-to-toe protective gear and head out to sample and test those people. And there are big signs that say, “We’ve got this.”\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe signs actually say, “We’ve got this?”\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nHandwritten signs all over the room.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what are you thinking when you see this?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI think I’ve finally found the coordinated response that this situation seems to call for.\n\n[music]\n\nThis is a room full of all the layers of government, from the state, to different agencies, to health care workers in their scrubs, coordinating to take on this crisis head-on. And after nearly a week of frightened townspeople and scared kids, this is exactly what you wanted to see. It was a relief.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Sarah, what happens next?\n\narchived recording What else can you tell us about this containment plan? archived recording (andrew cuomo) Think of it this way. We have 173 cases in the entire state. Right? We have 108 in New Rochelle.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAt this point, things are starting to get up and running in New Rochelle. We’re about two weeks out from the first diagnosis, and the National Guard is here. There is the incident command center. And that command center is sending people out to do in-home testing.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) — do what we have to do. But you know, Jake, this is a microcosm of what we’re going to be looking at. The numbers are going to go up consistently, because our testing is way behind the reality of what the situation is.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nBut still, it’s not enough. The numbers of people tested at this point are only in the hundreds.\n\narchived recording (andrew cuomo) China was doing 10,000 tests per day. This country, in total we’ve done about 5,000 tests. So we really have to get that testing capacity up if we’re going to make the difference.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nNew York state recognizes even what they’re doing there in New Rochelle, it’s not enough. We have to ramp up testing.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so how do they actually do that?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nActually, they saw what was happening in South Korea, where they’ve created these highly effective drive-through testing centers, managing to churn out 275,000 since diagnosis. And that happened, actually, around the same time that our country had its first case. So New York state decides we need these centers. And so I went to see this myself.\n\nsarah maslin nir So I’m recording this now standing outside the mobile drive-through testing center in a public park called Glen Island in Rochester.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nWhen you get to this beautiful island park, there’s seagulls wheeling overhead. There’s the Long Island Sound glinting. You arrive at what looks like three beautiful wedding tents. They’re tents that could be for any garden party. And you only realize what this is because of the cop who stops you at the drawbridge to this island with his megaphone blaring.\n\ncop Are you here for testing? Yes? OK. Keep your windows rolled up at all times. Have your ID ready. Windows rolled up at all times, windows closed at all times. Have your ID ready. You’re going over the drawbridge, and stay to the right. sarah maslin nir Thank you for helping us. chuck hamilton Sure.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nMy guide was a gentleman by the name of Chuck Hamilton. He was in charge of operations at that site.\n\nchuck hamilton There is three tents with six lanes. We’re being directed by our National Guard personnel right now.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd as we pulled up, you head down a meandering lane lined with orange cones and members of the National Guard and other police forces.\n\nchuck hamilton — will advise us to keep our windows closed at this particular point.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nThey demanded I put my ID on the windshield.\n\nchuck hamilton Windows closed up. sarah maslin nir Sir? government official Put your IDs up on the dash. chuck hamilton OK. All identification must now be put on the dash.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nThey don’t want you to open your window, hand them anything. So groups of people in Tyvek aprons, those respirator masks, lean over, peer through your windshield, tap your name and info into a tablet, and make sure you’re confirmed for your appointment at the drive-through testing center.\n\nchuck hamilton — stage two. sarah maslin nir And there are two silver — chuck hamilton These people are in full Tyvek hooded suits.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nNext, you’re waved from this first zone where they check you in, called a cold zone because there isn’t a risk of contamination there, to the hot zone.\n\nsarah maslin nir — full body suits? chuck hamilton Yes, these are all registered nurses, paramedics, or E.M.T.s. She’s indicating when you’re — you keep the window closed.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIn the hot zone, I was approached by two nurses in full, what looked to me like hazmat suits, eye shields, heads covered, every seal wrapped up tightly to make sure nothing could get through. I rolled down my window.\n\nnurse This is section two. So there’s section one, intake —\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nAnd they told me what they would do if I were in fact sick, which was tip my head back, thread a swab into my nostril and then another into the back of my throat with a tongue depressor, put those swabs in vials, and send those off to the lab.\n\nnurse I’d tell you to lean forward and tilt your head a little bit backwards, take a deep breath. I’m going to put the swab in. And that’s it. The other swab is the backup control.\n\n[music]\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI rolled up my window tightly and then moved on to the next station, where I was processed. And a woman held up a little handwritten sign that said, “Feel better.” I imagine that everybody else going through that line needed that sign real bad.\n\nsarah maslin nir So you’re in total protective gear. You’re doing this work. You’re on the front of the front of the front line. How do you feel?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI spoke to one nurse who was in that hazmat suit in the hot zone. And she appeared to me to be the age demographic that is at risk from coronavirus, which is 50-plus. And yet she felt this was the moment to step up.\n\nlisa I feel compelled to help, compelled to help. And you know, we have to be careful. One mistake could be a big problem, obviously. We can become contaminated. But this is the time — this is why we became nurses. This is the time to help. If we don’t do this, what do we do? sarah maslin nir What’s your name? lisa My name is Lisa —\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIf I’m not here, what am I doing?\n\nsarah maslin nir Can you spell the last name? lisa B, A, E, Z. And then hyphen —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo has this testing site been effective? Is it making a difference in containing and combating the virus?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIt is making a difference in figuring out who has this illness — and a tremendous difference. They have hustled, since it opened on Friday, 2,849 people through that drive-through as of our conversation, Michael. This is charging ahead and vastly increasing New York’s capacity to test these people. This is how we’re going to get a handle on this disease. To understand how it spreads, who’s affected by it, to model it forward, to know what we’re up against.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. You really can’t stop it until you can measure it.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nExactly. And you can’t protect people unless you know who’s got it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Sarah, at this point, the system that you have described to handle this acute crisis in New Rochelle is containment zone, the National Guard to keep it contained, but more importantly, keep people safe, clean, fed. And now there’s this mobile testing center nearby trying to figure out just how widely the virus has spread. Overall, is this starting to feel like a model for other places?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nMore than just feel like a model, it is the model for New York state’s response. In the coming week and weeks, more of exactly what’s happening in New Rochelle is going to be set up all over the state. Nassau County, Jones Beach, which isn’t too far, just got its first mobile testing center modeled off this. It’s coming to Staten Island in New York City, to Rockland County, another place not far away.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHmm.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nI met a man while I was out there in New Rochelle. We were standing outside a classroom where National Guard were scrubbing Legos. And he said to me, you know, they talk about reinventing the wheel, but this is inventing the wheel. And when we look back at how to handle these things in the future, people are going to look back and say, how did they do it in New Rochelle? And he might be right. The whole country might end up looking at this as a model, because the whole country might be in New Rochelle’s position soon. And this may be just what they have to go on.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd do you get the sense that what’s happening in New Rochelle — this invention of the wheel when it comes to how to deal with a pandemic in the United States — do you get the sense that it’s working and that this is basically all on the right track?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIt’s hard to know. Every day there are new cases. I don’t think we’ll know for a while what’s working. But it’s deeply comforting when you look out across the nation and the world and see this patchwork of responses that barely hang together, to know that here in this state, in this city, in New Rochelle, a herculean effort is being made to get this thing right and keep people safe.\n\nsarah maslin nir I am walking down North Avenue in New Rochelle. It’s the same block where the synagogue at the heart of this outbreak, Young Israel of New Rochelle sits closed at the other end of the street. And walking —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, Sarah, we have been talking about how this town has been totally transformed in what’s really just a matter of days, a couple weeks. A lot of outsiders coming in — National Guard, volunteers parachuting in to help. But what about the community itself? The people who are there in the city, in this containment zone, how are they handling this?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nMichael, this is a hard time to be anyone, in or out of the zone. And we are all looking for a dose of human goodness.\n\nsarah maslin nir And we were just talking outside. It’s a little intimidating, huh? A little scary? speaker 1 Mm-hmm. sarah maslin nir How do you feel about it? speaker 1 Sad. sarah maslin nir Why? speaker 1 Because people’s dying. sarah maslin nir But I want you to know that that’s just a very few older people. And I don’t want you to feel scared. Do you — speaker 1 I’m not scared. sarah maslin nir You’re not?\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nIf you go to New Rochelle and you see people asked unimaginable things, asked to cut themselves off from everyone they love to protect everyone else, you see people willingly doing it.\n\nsarah maslin nir How are you holding up? speaker 2 We’ve been doing a lot of deliveries. As you can see, there’s no one in the restaurant right now except you and I and some staff.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nPeople, as much as they’ve been put upon and wish it were otherwise, they are resolute and resilient. And they’re accepting this because they know it’s for a greater purpose.\n\nspeaker 2 We just want to make sure that the stress level and the anguish that the public might be feeling, that they feel that everything that can be done is being done for their health. sarah maslin nir Are you helping out too? speaker 1 Yeah. sarah maslin nir Are you going to pack any bags or give any bags to any of the families? speaker 1 Mm-hmm.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nFrom the delivery people who’ve worked out systems to leave bags of food on a staircase and run away with a wave, to the sick people indoors waiting for that meal —\n\nspeaker 3 What we’ve been doing, as I’ve coined the phrase, the drop and dash. So you literally pull up to the house, you drop the bag off, and you run like the wind. And that’s it.\n\nsarah maslin nir\n\nEverybody gets it. Everybody just wants everyone else to get better.\n\nspeaker 3 — feel like someone cares about them. Yes, they’re quarantined. It’s a terrible thing. And when I pick up the phone, and I see a name that I recognize, I speak to them. I say, how are you holding up? And they ask me the same thing. How are you holding up? And we both crack a joke and we laugh and that’s it. You got to keep a sense of humor with this whole thing. And it’s terrible for everyone. It really — my heart is aching for them, and they feel the same way about me.\n\n[music]\n\nspeaker 3 This whole thing is just bringing everyone together, hopefully not literally because that’s how corona spreads. sarah maslin nir You got to laugh, huh? speaker 3 Yeah. You got to laugh. sarah maslin nir It’s the only way to get through it. speaker 3 100 percent. sarah maslin nir Are you going to go out on another delivery now? speaker 3 Um, I don’t have anything at the moment.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHere’s what else you need to know today. On Wednesday, the United States and Canada said they would close their shared border to all but essential travel, becoming the latest countries to restrict border crossings to slow the spread of the pandemic.\n\narchived recording (justin trudeau) In both our countries, we’re encouraging people to stay home. We’re telling our citizens not to visit their neighbors if they don’t absolutely have to. Well, this collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMeanwhile in Washington, the Senate approved a relief package already passed by the House, that provides sick leave, unemployment benefits, free coronavirus testing, and food and medical aid to Americans affected by the pandemic. President Trump quickly signed the legislation into law, the first of several congressional bills related to the coronavirus that he is expected to support.\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) The Congress has an enormous role to play in responding to this challenge, and we are determined to do that duty.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn a speech from the Senate floor, Republican majority leader Mitch McConnell called for a bipartisan approach to the crisis.\n\narchived recording (mitch mcconnell) This is not a challenge anyone wanted for our nation, but it is a challenge we will overcome. Someday, hopefully soon, our nation will have this virus on its heels.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat’s it for “The Daily.” I’m Michael Barbaro. See you tomorrow.\n\n[music]",

    "article_text": "“There’s all this ‘doom and gloom for local journalism stories’ that have happened in the last week or so, and I hope that other people see what we’re doing and understand that the important thing is the journalism — it’s the stories, it’s the investigations — that’s what matters,” Mr. Ward said. He will also be on the staff of the nonprofit investigative powerhouse ProPublica and will have support from Report for America, another growing nonprofit organization that sends young reporters to newsrooms around the country.\n\nThe news business, like every business, is looking for all the help it can get in this crisis. Analysts believe that the new federal aid package will help for a time and that the industry has a strong case to make. State governments have deemed journalism an essential service to spread public health information. Reporters employed by everyone from the worthiest nonprofit group to the most cynical hedge fund-owned chain are risking their lives to get their readers solid facts on the pandemic, and are holding the government accountable for its failures. Virtually every news outlet reports that readership is at an all-time high. We all need to know, urgently, about where and how the coronavirus is affecting our cities and towns and neighborhoods.\n\nBut the advertising business that has sustained the local newspapers — the car dealers, retailers and movie theaters that for generations filled their pages with ads — has gone from slow decline to free fall.\n\nSo the leaders trying to get the local news industry through this economic shock need to confront reality. The revenue from print advertising and aging print subscribers was already going away. When this crisis is over, it is unlikely to come back. Some local weeklies recently shut down for good.\n\nMany of the worthy suggestions for saving the news business dodge this central issue. Margaret Sullivan, at The Washington Post, suggested a broad “coronavirus stimulus plan,” and a column in The Atlantic called for a huge government spending on public health ads. Without careful restrictions, a huge share of that government money will go to doomed newspaper chains for whom a major goal, as Gannett’s chief executive said on his last earnings call in late February, is paying a dividend to shareholders unwise enough to invest in his doomed business. (Gannett executives declined to speak to me for this column.)",

Imagine what that would mean to the American people. Imagine what that would mean to tell someone they were positive when they weren’t.”\n\nIt was not clear where Dr. Birx got those figures, but obviously such an inaccurate test would be worthless. Late on Tuesday night, Dr. Birx confirmed that although she was responding to a question about the W.H.O. test, she was referring to a study of an early diagnostic test used in China.\n\nThe paper found that, in a specific subset of those tested in China — asymptomatic contacts of known cases — the tests wrongly found them to be positive 47 percent of the time.",

    "article_text": "The rest of the country may regard New York as a black hole of need. But in fact the opposite has always been true; we’re forever sweeping more into the federal till than we receive in services. In 2018, according to the state comptroller’s office, we gave $26.6 billion more to Washington than we got back, ranking us dead last for federal benefits.\n\nNow, we finally have a native New Yorker in the White House to do something about this discrepancy. Instead, he’s the worst offender, and this time the consequences will be lethal.\n\nPart of me can’t help but wonder if Trump is just playing to his base, which views cities with suspicion, perhaps New York above all. We are multiculturalism personified — home of the United Nations, a place where 637 languages and dialects are spoken. A purée while the rest of the nation is vegetable soup, as Spalding Gray once lovingly said.\n\nNever mind that Trump is himself a creature of New York, just a different dimension of New York. Tabloid New York, real estate New York and (above all, and most ironically) global New York, which made possible his worldwide hotels, his construction projects made of Chinese steel, his loans from Deutsche Bank. It’s a New York he now disavows. A New York he now blames.\n\nBut it was New York that made him a reality television star. And what reality television prizes more than anything, we’ve learned, is a Darwinian frame of mind. The contestants aren’t there to make friends. They’re there to destroy each other. They’re there to win. Only the best win.\n\nBut this is not a game. Trump has no clue how to marshal the forces of federal government, which he stripped down to the studs. He has no unifying instincts at all. New York will be gasping for breath, and the other states will soon follow. Unless he takes action, now.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We’d like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips.

Crosby in “America’s Forgotten Pandemic.” “One nurse found a husband dead in the same room where his wife lay with newly born twins. It had been twenty-four hours since the death and the births, and the wife had had no food but an apple which happened to lie within reach.”\n\nIn 1918, the world was a very different place, even without the disruptive influence of World War I. Doctors knew viruses existed but had never seen one — there were no electron microscopes, and the genetic material of viruses had not yet been discovered. Today, however, researchers not only know how to isolate a virus but can find its genetic sequence, test antiviral drugs and develop a vaccine.\n\nIn 1918, it was impossible to test people with mild symptoms so they could self-quarantine. And it was nearly impossible to do contact tracing because the flu seemed to infect — and panic — entire cities and communities all at once. Moreover, there was little protective equipment for health care workers, and the supportive care with respirators that can be provided to people very ill with coronavirus did not exist.\n\nWith a case fatality rate of at least 2.5 percent, the 1918 flu was far more deadly than ordinary flu, and it was so infectious that it spread widely, which meant the number of deaths soared.",

Bishop Rodgers said that his congregation would continue to support its members in many ways and check on their well-being. But it would have to be at a distance.\n\n“We certainly want to be good citizens,” he said, adding that he knew of a funeral that had been attended by one person who was sick, which spread the virus to others. “All it takes is for one person to be sick, and many have been affected.”\n\nAs the tornado touched down, moving from south to north, some said they were at home watching the local television news, seeing in real time the funnel forming over the meteorologist’s shoulders. It caused significant damage at the Mall at Turtle Creek and at an Anheuser-Busch granary. Cars were picked up and tossed aside. Part of a freight train was knocked over.\n\n“All I could hear was just the most horrific exploding,” said Sharon Gore, 60, who could see the destroyed mall from her driveway. “There was so much glass cracking. I couldn’t believe it. I was just calling the name of Jesus over and over again, because I couldn’t even get a prayer out. It was like bombs were dropping.”\n\nJonesboro, a city of about 75,000 in northeast Arkansas, had been devastated by tornadoes before. A storm in 1968 killed 34 people and injured some 300 others. Another storm in 1973 also left a trail of destruction. Three people were killed, but it was hailed as a “miracle” for not being deadlier.",

    "article_text": "Four features of Covid-19 combine to create a perfect pandemic storm: It’s highly contagious (more so than the flu, but less so than measles). It’s new, so few people have immunity. It causes infection without symptoms in some people, who can unknowingly infect others. And it can latch on to receptors in the lung, causing severe pneumonia much more frequently (perhaps 10 times more) than seasonal flu.\n\nDespite common perceptions, it’s not just the elderly and frail who are at significant risk of a life-threatening complication. Data from China suggest that many chronic health problems increase the likelihood of a bad outcome, including cardiovascular disease, which affects nearly half the adults in the United States in some form, and diabetes, which affects about 10 percent. In Italy, 99 percent of the fatalities were people with pre-existing medical problems, especially hypertension.\n\nMoreover, in the United States, obesity-related metabolic conditions may put the public at exceptional risk. Today, more than two of three adults have high body weight, and 42 percent have obesity, among the highest rates in the world. Almost two in 10 children have obesity. Excessive weight, and the poor-quality diet that causes it, is strongly associated with insulin resistance, chronic inflammation and other abnormalities that may lower immunity to viral respiratory infection or predispose to complications.\n\nIn a California study of the 2009 influenza pandemic, people with obesity were twice as likely to be hospitalized compared with the state population. Among those who were hospitalized, the risk of dying was significantly increased for people with severe obesity. A small study conducted in 2013 of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), caused by another coronavirus, reported a similar relationship.\n\nWe don’t know yet whether these preliminary findings will apply to Covid-19. However, the high prevalence of obesity-related chronic disease at all ages raises serious concern. Only 12 percent of Americans over age 20 are considered metabolically healthy — that is, with optimal measures for waist circumference, blood sugar, blood pressure and lipids, and not taking drugs to control these risk factors. Indeed, reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that younger adults are being hospitalized for Covid-19 disease at alarming rates.",

    "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/27/upshot/coronavirus-new-york-comparison.html",
    "article_text": "If the rate of growth in coronavirus cases in the New York metro area continues, it will suffer a more severe outbreak than those experienced within the city limits of Wuhan, China, or in the Lombardy region of Italy.\n\nThere is no guarantee, of course, that current trends will continue. What has happened to this point can’t be used to predict what will happen next. It is possible that social distancing will soon slow or arrest the growth of cases.\n\nBut what can be said is that the New York metro area has had less success in flattening the curve, at this point in its outbreak, than the city of Wuhan or the Lombardy region did at the same point in theirs. And some other American metropolitan areas appear to be on a similar path.\n\nHere are four ways to measure the size of the outbreak across the country’s metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas.\n\nHow Bad Is It Now? Cases Per 1,000 People\n\nThe New York City area has more known cases per capita than any other metro area in the United States.\n\nConfirmed cases per 1,000 by metro area Metro or micro area Population cases Per thousand Figures as of March 26; includes micropolitan statistical areas\n\nPros of this measure Focuses on communities where the disease is prevalent. Cons Varying testing rates make comparisons difficult. Not all confirmed cases are active.\n\nIn the early stages of an outbreak, the population size doesn’t matter — one infected person will probably infect a few people, whether that person lives in a metropolitan area of 100,000 or one of 10 million. But as an epidemic progresses, the number of cases per capita can provide a good measure of the prevalence of coronavirus in a community. Per capita measurements also give a sense of how strained a community’s health care system has become, since larger places tend to have more medical resources.\n\nTo make useful per capita comparisons, we’ve focused on metropolitan areas instead of countries or cities or U.S. states. That’s because metropolitan areas roughly correspond with the regions where the virus might spread quickly among families, co-workers or commuters. The New York City metropolitan area includes nearby cities and suburbs in Westchester, Long Island, and northern New Jersey, as well as sprawling, outlying areas that stretch even farther from the city.\n\nConfirmed cases per thousand residents As of March 26; includes micropolitan statistical areas.\n\nOur tables include numbers from Lombardy and Wuhan to provide a benchmark for metro areas in the United States. The comparisons are illustrative, but not exact. Those outbreaks have been going on longer, which means their case numbers are spread over more time. In most of the U.S., cases are from only the last month.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases is an imperfect measure of what we really care about: the prevalence of the virus in the population, and therefore — if it is early in the epidemic — how many people are sick or may be contagious. The limited availability of testing in some places means that many people with coronavirus won’t be counted among the confirmed cases. And the varying rates of testing across states and countries make it hard to compare the number of confirmed cases in different regions.\n\nHow Bad Is It Now? Deaths Per 1,000 People\n\nDeaths per capita are currently higher in the New York City area than in most other places.\n\nMetro or micro area Population deaths Per thousand As of March 26; includes only metro areas with three deaths or more.\n\nPros of this measure Coronavirus deaths are much more likely to be accurately counted than total cases. Cons Death rates depend on the underlying health and age of various communities. They also lag infections by several weeks, so they don’t tell us what’s happening now.\n\nExamining deaths can allow for a more direct comparison between communities, since it avoids many of the problems with variable testing. Testing differences matter less in measuring deaths because in most places with established outbreaks in the United States, the sickest patients are getting tested. (That may be less true in other parts of the world: Patients who die outside hospitals in Britain and Italy have, in some cases, been omitted from official data.)\n\nBut measuring only deaths has drawbacks, too. We know that the death rate from coronavirus differs depending on the age and health of the populations affected and the availability of medical resources, like ventilators. That means that per capita rates may look high in places where the virus has infiltrated nursing homes, for example, even if it has not spread widely through the rest of the community.\n\nBecause patients who die of Covid-19 tend to be sick for weeks first, counting deaths may also understate the current size of the outbreak in a given place if it is growing quickly.\n\nConfirmed deaths per thousand residents As of March 26; includes only metro areas with three deaths or more.\n\nHow Bad Could It Get? Growth Rates Over Time\n\nThe number of cases in the New York area is still growing quickly.\n\nTo assess the possible future of the outbreak, it’s helpful to look not just at the number of cases but also at how quickly they are increasing. The accompanying chart shows the growth rate of cumulative cases over time, averaged over the previous week.\n\nPros of this measure Growth rates help us judge whether the epidemic is getting better or worse in a given place right now. Cons The timing of different outbreaks can make comparisons difficult. Case data quality varies a lot by place.\n\nHere, we can see whether the trajectory of a local epidemic is getting better or worse. A growth rate of 40 percent on this chart means the cumulative number of cases is growing by 40 percent every day. A rate of 100 percent would mean that the number of cases was doubling daily.\n\nPublic health officials have been talking about the value of social distancing measures as a way to “flatten the curve” of the epidemic. Such a flattening would mean that the rates in this chart are falling, eventually to zero. New York’s current growth rate is just over 30 percent, suggesting that its curve remains quite steep, and that the disease is continuing to spread rapidly throughout the region.\n\nIn some other metro areas, like Baton Rouge, La., the growth rate is high, but the number of cases is still low. That means the community may still have time to flatten its curve before the outbreak becomes widespread. But communities with a lot of cases and a high growth rate are on track to have a serious problem. A high growth rate on top of a large number of cases means that a still larger number of people are on track to become ill or die.\n\nHow Bad Could It Get? Growth Rates by Case Count\n\nCase numbers in the New York area are also growing quickly given the size of its outbreak.\n\nAverage daily change in total cases, over the previous 7 days Confirmed cases per thousand people →\n\nPros of this measure Helps distinguish between places where cases are growing fast with few cases and places where cases are numerous and still growing fast. Cons Hard to read. Relies on case data.\n\nThe chart above shows the growth rate by the number of cases in a given place. This measurement shows whether a community has succeeded in slowing the rate of growth before there are many cases. In other words, it shows whether a community is succeeding at flattening the curve.\n\nBy this measure, the situation in the New York area does not appear promising. The rate of increase in cases is far higher for the number of cases than it was in Wuhan or Lombardy, once they had reached similar numbers of cases. Other U.S. metropolitan areas, like Detroit and New Orleans, stand out as places where a coronavirus outbreak might escalate quickly without preventive measures. The Seattle and San Francisco areas, in contrast, seem to have made serious progress in flattening the curve.\n\nThe chart also helps avoid the illusion of success created by a slow, initial rate of growth. Many charts depict the growth of cases over time, and it can be easy to assume that the communities that get an outbreak quickly, and therefore appear above the pack on the chart, are faring the worst. But a community that experiences a high rate of growth with a large number of cases is in serious trouble, regardless of whether the outbreak occurs 10 or 100 days after it had its first cases.",

    "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/03/11/us/virus-health-workers.html",
    "article_text": "As coronavirus infections accumulate across America, hospitals are facing new urgency to keep their workers safe.\n\nIn China, where the virus was first discovered, protecting health care workers was a serious challenge. More than 3,300 nurses, doctors and other hospital staff members across the country were infected, many because of insufficient protective equipment.\n\nIn the United States, many hospitals are already struggling with limited supplies of masks, gowns and goggles, as health officials figure out the best way to protect workers. On Thursday, the U.S. surpassed China in total reported cases of Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\n“We need to think about what the right thing is for patients, but also for our caregivers, to make sure they’re not exposed,” said Amy Compton-Phillips, chief clinical officer at the Providence St. Joseph Health, a hospital network headquartered in Washington State that is currently treating more than 400 confirmed coronavirus patients across seven states.\n\nThat means shoring up supplies of protective gear and making space to isolate and treat patients as cases mount.\n\nProtective equipment: gowns, gloves, goggles and respirators\n\nCurrent C.D.C. recommendations for health care workers Eye protection Goggles or face shield Respirator or medical mask N95 respirator, if available Gown Closed securely at the back Gloves Pulled up over gown sleeves Current C.D.C. recommendations for health care workers Eye protection Goggles or face shield Respirator or medical mask N95 respirator, if available Gloves Pulled up over gown sleeves Gown Closed securely at the back Current C.D.C. recommendations for health care workers Eye protection Goggles or face shield Respirator or medical mask N95 respirator, if available Gloves Pulled up over gown sleeves Gown Closed securely at the back\n\nThere is still some uncertainty about how the new coronavirus spreads, but experts agree it is most likely passed through close contact with people who are infected, and specifically the viral droplets they expel when they cough or sneeze.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised health care workers to wear protective gowns, gloves, goggles and masks while treating potential and confirmed cases of Covid-19, to avoid exposure. But there has been some disagreement over which masks are needed.\n\nInitially, the agency advised the use of respirator masks that fit tightly over the nose and mouth to filter out virus particles before they are inhaled, such as the N95. (Health care workers could also wear devices known as PAPRs, or powered air-purifying respirators, which cover the entire head.)\n\nBut with respirators in short supply across the country, the C.D.C. updated its recommendations in early March to allow the use of standard medical masks for most coronavirus patient care. These looser-fitting masks protect against droplet transmission from coughs and sneezes, but do not filter out airborne pathogens.\n\nThe change puts the agency in closer alignment with World Health Organization guidelines, which only require respirator masks during special procedures that may result in the spray of tiny viral particles. But it drew sharp rebuke from a national nurses union.\n\nN95 respirator Surgical mask Tight fit; must be specially fitted. Filters out 95% of small particles. Loose fit around edges. Provides protection from large droplets. Surgical mask N95 respirator Loose fit around edges. Provides protection from large droplets. Tight fit; must be specially fitted. Filters out 95% of small particles. N95 respirator Tight fit; must be specially fitted. Filters out 95% of small particles. Surgical mask Loose fit around edges. Provides protection from large droplets.\n\nA global surge in demand for protective gear and supply chain disruptions in China have led to dire shortages of both kinds of masks in many U.S. hospitals. Supplies of gowns, gloves and eyewear are also low.\n\n“We have significant limitations on our high-level N95 masks, and even surgical masks are in short supply,” said Dr. Compton-Phillips of Providence St. Joseph Health.\n\n“I cannot ask people to go into battle unarmed, and that’s what we would have to do if we ran out of PPE,” she said, using the acronym for personal protective equipment.\n\nRepresentatives from hospitals across the country said they were taking steps to preserve their protective equipment supplies, including limiting the number of people who enter a patient’s room to essential personnel only, and grouping Covid-19 patients together so doctors and nurses don’t need to put on new gear for every interaction. Some health care workers are reusing disposable masks over multiple days. Under normal circumstances, masks and other equipment are discarded between patients.\n\n“This pandemic is not a sprint, it’s like a marathon, and we’re trying to keep as many people as healthy as long as we can,” said Dr. Teresa Amato, chair of emergency medicine at Long Island Jewish Forest Hills, a hospital in Queens that is currently treating more than a 100 coronavirus patients.\n\nMajor manufacturers, like 3M, have increased mask production, and local companies have converted factories to join the effort. Governors in several states have tapped the nation’s safety net of emergency preparedness equipment: the Strategic National Stockpile, which contained about 13 million N95 respirator masks and 30 million surgical masks at the beginning of the outbreak. But some governors reported receiving less protective gear than they requested.\n\nThe U.S. surgeon general, Jerome M. Adams, last month urged the public to stop buying masks to lessen the strain on supply. Masks are not very effective for protecting casual wearers from Covid-19, he said, but are crucial for health care workers who are in close contact with infected patients.\n\nIsolating patients with Covid-19\n\nThe C.D.C. recommends coronavirus patients be isolated in single rooms, behind closed doors, away from other patients. But more severe cases may require the use of a special room with negative pressure, which allows air to move inward but not escape back into general circulation.\n\nOutside Air vent Bathroom HEPA filter Area of lower air pressure Hallway Anteroom Negative pressure allows air to flow inwards, but not out of the room.

Outside Air vent Bathroom HEPA filter Hallway Area of lower air pressure Anteroom Negative pressure allows air to flow inwards, but not out of the room. Note: This is one possible layout for a negative pressure isolation room; an anteroom is optional, and air flow systems may vary.\n\nNegative pressure isolation rooms are recommended for special procedures that may result in the spray of tiny viral particles, like intubation for patients who need help breathing, or bronchoscopy, a procedure that allows doctors to examine a patient’s lungs. Respirator masks are required during these procedures, too.\n\nMost people infected with the new coronavirus do not require hospitalization, but medical systems in many cities and states are already straining as the outbreak accelerates. Many hospitals are cancelling nonessential procedures to free up beds as they anticipate an influx of new patients.\n\nPatients with mild coronavirus infections and no underlying medical conditions are also being asked to quarantine at home. “If you are healthy — even if you have Covid but are not ill enough to be in a hospital — we don’t want to treat you in the hospital,” said Dr. Compton-Phillips.\n\nAccording to the W.H.O., 80 percent of Covid-19 patients in China experienced a mild or moderate form of the illness, 14 percent had a severe form, and 6 percent became critically ill. Older people and those with prior health conditions were at the highest risk.\n\n“Hopefully most of the people who are sick can be cared for at home and only those with serious respiratory conditions and the elderly who need I.C.U. care are the ones who get admitted to a hospital,” said Dr. Gabor D. Kelen, the director of the Johns Hopkins Office of Critical Event Preparedness and Response and the emergency medicine department. “But if we really get inundated the way they did in some parts of China, you get to the point that you can’t operate normally.”\n\nDetermining the proper precautions\n\nThe gear health care workers need to protect themselves and how they isolate patients depends largely on how an illness is transmitted.\n\nAirborne spread up to 100 ft Measles, tuberculosis Smaller, lighter aerosol droplets can linger in the air. Influenza, whooping cough, and most likely Covid-19, per W.H.O. Larger, heavier viral droplets fall to the ground after being expelled. DROPLET SPREAD Up to 6 feet Influenza, whooping cough, and most likely Covid-19, per W.H.O. Larger, heavier viral droplets fall to the ground after being expelled. AIRBORNE SPREAD Up to 100 feet Measles, tuberculosis Smaller, lighter aerosol droplets can linger in the air. Airborne spread up to 100 ft Measles, tuberculosis Smaller, lighter aerosol droplets can linger in the air. Influenza, whooping cough, and most likely Covid-19, per W.H.O.

Larger, heavier viral droplets fall to the ground after being expelled. AIRBORNE SPREAD Up to 100 feet Measles, tuberculosis Smaller, lighter aerosol droplets can linger in the air.\n\nSome illnesses, like measles and tuberculosis, can spread far and wide through the air. Their ability to linger in the air for hours and travel long distances after a sneeze or cough makes them highly contagious.\n\nThese illnesses are treated at a high level of precaution that requires health care workers to wear respirator masks and patients to be isolated under negative pressure to keep the germs from spreading.\n\nBut experts think that other respiratory illnesses, like the flu, do not stay airborne for long. Instead, the viral droplets that leave a person’s mouth or nose end up falling to the ground within six feet or less. Think of it more like a sprinkle of rain than a cloud of mist.\n\nThe W.H.O. has said Covid-19 is most likely spread through this droplet route.\n\nSuch illnesses are usually transmitted through close contact, within family groups or during large gatherings, and can also be transferred by touching infected surfaces.\n\nHealth care workers routinely treat droplet-borne illnesses at a lower level of precaution than fully airborne ones, using medical masks rather than respirators. But for new diseases, like Covid-19, health authorities may recommend higher-level protections while the transmissibility question remains unsettled. And those guidelines can evolve over time.\n\n“During the outbreak, you’re going to see changing guidance for hospital workers,” said Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Where the new coronavirus falls in terms of mortality and risk perception “will change as we start to get more data within the United States,” he said.\n\nThe most recent C.D.C. guidelines — which suggest the use of medical masks while treating coronavirus patients when respirators are not available — drew criticism from some health care professionals, notably nurses.\n\n“Now is not the time to be weakening our standards and protections, or cutting corners,” said Bonnie Castillo, a registered nurse and executive director of National Nurses United, a union that represents about 150,000 nurses across the country. “If nurses and health care workers aren’t protected, that means patients and the public are not protected,” she said.\n\nOther medical experts said the new recommendations did not go far enough to clarify how health care workers dealing with the outbreak should be protected.\n\n“We want health care workers to be confident they are being kept safe,” Dr. Adalja said.",

    "article_text": "If you think a cruise ship is a dangerous place to be during a pandemic, consider America’s jails and prisons. The new coronavirus spreads at its quickest in closed environments. And places like nursing homes in affected areas have begun to take precautions at the behest of families and experts. As this new disease spreads, it has become equally important for all of us to ask what steps are being taken to protect the health of people in jails and prisons, and the staff who work in them.\n\nThe American criminal legal system holds almost 2.3 million people in prisons, jails, detention centers and psychiatric hospitals. And they do not live under quarantine: jails experience a daily influx of correctional staff, vendors, health care workers, educators and visitors — all of whom carry viral conditions at the prison back to their homes and communities and return the next day packing the germs from back home. How will we prevent incarcerated people and those who work in these institutions from becoming ill and spreading the virus?\n\nThis week, the Harris County Juvenile Court in Houston announced that the court wing will be fully closed to all until further notice, after officials reported that a person who had been in the court may test positive for coronavirus. And an employee at a correctional facility in Pennsylvania also tested positive for Covid-19. Thirty-four inmates and staffers there are now in quarantine. On Friday, the Federal Department of Correction announced that incarcerated people at all 122 federal correctional facilities across the country will not be allowed visits from family, friends or attorneys for 30 days, in response to the threat of the coronavirus. But this ethical sacrifice raises more questions than it answers about the broader set of changes that will be required to limit this contagion while protecting the rights of incarcerated people.\n\nIn America’s jails and prisons, people share bathrooms, laundry and eating areas. The toilets in their cells rarely have lids. The toilet tank doubles as the sink for hand washing, tooth brushing and other hygiene. People bunked in the same cell — often as many as four — share these toilets and sinks. Meanwhile, hand sanitizer is not allowed in most prisons because of its alcohol content. Air circulation is nearly always poor. Windows rarely open; soap may only be available if you can pay for it from the commissary.",

And without the kind of full-court-press efforts that China staged to guard against the virus’s spread, some analysts worried that infections could expand widely.\n\nEconomists at the Institute of International Finance slashed their outlook for the global economy on Thursday, downgrading their 2020 forecast for the growth in the United States to 1.3 percent that in China to below 4 percent.

    "article_text": "The next round of social distancing will be activated more rapidly, because officials — and the public — will be more prepared. It should also be shorter, because we can assume that most of the people who were initially infected are likely to be immune next time around. But it will still disrupt people’s lives and the economy. We will still have canceled conferences and sporting events. People will not frequent restaurants and will not travel. The service industry will be severely curtailed. And it’s going to happen again and again.\n\nMaybe the best analogy is pumping a car’s brakes on an icy road. Either doing nothing or slamming on the brakes leads to an accident. So we pump the brakes — pushing on the brakes, then easing up, and then applying them again — and after three or four times we slow down enough to stop.\n\nWhen will the coronavirus be tamed like influenza, if not conquered like smallpox? A vaccine would need to be administered to an estimated 45 percent to 70 percent of the population — at least 145 million people — to stop the spread of the virus. If we are lucky, and an effective vaccine is quickly developed, this could happen by the fall of 2021.\n\nIt might even be sooner if researchers can come up with an effective treatment that, in addition to preventing deaths, reduces the infectiousness of each case. One antiviral drug, remdesivir, has shown promise in treating monkeys infected with a similar coronavirus, and is being studied in humans. Trials of other drugs will begin soon. Again, if we are lucky, these trials may identify one or more effective treatments in four to five months.\n\nThe alternative to this roller coaster would be even more drastic. It would require sustaining social distancing until there are no more cases whatsoever and then closing borders to all travelers — no contact with the outside world — for 18 months or more. While the United States and many other countries, like Denmark and Germany, have instituted travel bans, sealing the country off for over a year until a coronavirus vaccine is discovered seems implausible. But who knows. If the situation becomes dire enough, the previously impossible could become inevitable.\n\nOn a positive note, each time the virus resurges after social distancing is relaxed, it will do so more slowly. But the flattened curve we are all hoping for — the one that is so critical to our health care infrastructure — will not actually be flat. It is more likely to be a series of ascents and descents, with dampened oscillations. So all of us — health care workers, policymakers and American citizens — need to get ready for a bumpy ride.\n\nEzekiel J.

    "article_text": "“Everyone knows Chinese people are disgusting.” “They’ll eat any type of animal.” “They’re dirty.” That’s what my classmate said, just days after the Coronavirus outbreak started in the United States. It felt like a stab to my chest. I’m Chinese-American, and this is someone that I’ve gone to school with for almost three years, who I consider a friend. But it’s no wonder that she feels this way. “An obscure virus arising from a meat market in eastern China.” As the Coronavirus spreads, there’s another virus spreading that we need to be talking about. “A woman who’s Asian says she was punched by another woman in midtown Manhattan and she accused her of having the Covid-19 virus.” “I don’t want him [inaudible] me. Tell him to move.” Young Asian-Americans like me are feeling hate infect every part of our lives. “And I’d like to just ask the Chinese for a formal apology.” Not only do we have to be afraid about our health. But we have to be afraid about being ourselves. Class basically just started. One of the girls said all Chinese people were disgusting. And so I literally like raised my hand up and was like “I’m Chinese.” She didn’t even say sorry. She didn’t. She just like blew past it I guess. And then she like kept going on about it. I never knew it would happen to me, especially at this school. Good morning. Morning. Yeah, basically this Chinese restaurant was like texting their customers saying none of our staff have been to China. We have no contact with the Coronavirus. Please like like, come back to us. And people were like making fun of it. There are thousands and thousands of cases in Italy. But no one’s boycotting Olive Garden. No seriously like, no one is boycotting a mom and pop’s pizza place. Like it’s the same thing. Historically, pandemics have stoked xenophobia. In the 19th century, people spread rumors that Irish immigrants carried cholera, and tuberculosis was known as the “Jewish disease.” In 1900, when a Chinese man supposedly died of the plague in San Francisco, Chinatown residents were forcibly quarantined by police, while white residents were allowed to leave the area. It seems like since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak schools have been a Petri dish for racism. It’s dangerous to normalize behavior like this for people my age. So you just spoke with the other student. So can you tell me what happened? She understood my frustration and anger. They didn’t really mean to say that. And they were actually making a generalization. And so she apologized to me basically. And I really appreciated it. Coronavirus may have originated in China. But the disease doesn’t discriminate in the way that people do. It’s extremely important that people have accurate information on how to stay safe. So we can kill this virus without spreading another one.",

    "article_text": "Importantly, that robust immune response also prevents transmission. If a germ can’t secure its hold on your body, your body no longer serves as a vector to send it forward to the next potential host. This is true even if that next person is not yet immune. When enough of us represent such “dead ends” for viral transmission, spread through the population is blunted, and eventually terminated. This is called herd immunity.\n\nWhat we know so far about the coronavirus makes it a unique case for the potential application of a “herd immunity” approach, a strategy viewed as a desirable side effect in the Netherlands, and briefly considered in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe data from South Korea, where tracking the coronavirus has been by far the best to date, indicate that as much as 99 percent of active cases in the general population are “mild” and do not require specific medical treatment. The small percentage of cases that do require such services are highly concentrated among those age 60 and older, and further so the older people are. Other things being equal, those over age 70 appear at three times the mortality risk as those age 60 to 69, and those over age 80 at nearly twice the mortality risk of those age 70 to 79.\n\nThese conclusions are corroborated by the data from Wuhan, China, which show a higher death rate, but an almost identical distribution. The higher death rate in China may be real, but is perhaps a result of less widespread testing. South Korea promptly, and uniquely, started testing the apparently healthy population at large, finding the mild and asymptomatic cases of Covid-19 other countries are overlooking. The experience of the Diamond Princess cruise ship, which houses a contained, older population, proves the point. The death rate among that insular and uniformly exposed population is roughly 1 percent.\n\nWe have, to date, fewer than 200 deaths from the coronavirus in the United States — a small data set from which to draw big conclusions. Still, it is entirely aligned with the data from other countries. The deaths have been mainly clustered among the elderly, those with significant chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease, and those in both groups.",

Most bereavement therapists call this missing someone while they’re still alive “anticipatory grief,” the purgatorial wait before death.\n\nThat started when we went through the logistics driving home from the hospital on Tuesday. He told me that he does not want to be kept alive without hope for recovery. He told me how he would want me to hold memorial services in New York and Los Angeles, where he grew up, when it’s safe for people to come back together.\n\nI know, I think, what grief will look like. In my reporting on food and death, I spoke to widows across the country who could barely eat, barely cook, because food was so integral to their memories of family life. Even years after their spouses died, dinnertime — that daily habit of sharing a meal — was where it hurt the most.\n\nI’ll miss him drinking coffee in his favorite brown bear mug, his voice at the other end of the telephone. I’ll want to call him and then remember that I can’t anymore. He’s still very much alive, but I’m bracing for a future where he isn’t.\n\nI know I have to be ready for another 5 a.m. drive back to the hospital, doing 40 in the right lane, windshield-wiping away silent tears. But no good musical ever ended on a ballad. And I don’t know how to say “I love you, Dad,” better than to do so often and simply. So for now, we’re just going to enjoy each other’s company, open another bottle of wine and hope for the best.\n\nAmelia Nierenberg (@AJNierenberg) is the newsroom fellow for The Times’s Food section.\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

    "headline": "A Virus Put My Asthmatic Son in the I.C.U. What Could ...",
    "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/parenting/coronavirus-asthma-kids.html",
    "article_text": "Today, he gets an inhaled steroid every day, two puffs in the morning and two at night. He breathes deeply 20 times. He rinses his mouth. “Some sharks die if they stop swimming,” he will say. He likes to talk about sharks and their strong, boneless bodies. “They never get sick. They’re immune to fevers!” I fill his humidifier with cold water. I set the emergency inhaler by his bed.\n\nAlthough most people will not remember, three years ago, in late winter, another virus was scaring parents in my community. Unlike this coronavirus, which appears to be most severe in older people, respiratory syncytial virus, or R.S.V., is responsible for around 57,000 hospitalizations of young children in the United States every year. Many of them will have asthma. Even though parents at my son’s preschool talked about the seasonal spike in infections at the time, the risk of R.S.V., seemed far away. Or something only happening to children who were born premature.\n\nThen a bad cold hit. My 2-year-old son had a fever of 103.8 and rapid breathing I’d never seen. I wrapped him in a blanket and rushed him to the hospital, where we learned he had R.S.V. His blood oxygen level was at 76 percent on admittance. It should be close to 100 percent and any level lower than 95 percent is cause for concern. It took hours to get him stable, and four days in the intensive care unit before we could take him home.\n\nThe shock of that experience makes the threat of this new virus feel uncomfortably close. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said the new coronavirus, which causes the disease Covid-19, is so far not infecting children as frequently or severely as adults. No one yet seems to know why, and that’s partly because the virus, which originated in China, is so new. “Most of the information we’re getting is from China,” said Dr. Sharon A. McGrath-Morrow, M.D., a professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University. “But it looks like generally children have been spared the more severe manifestations of this virus.”\n\nFor me — and, I imagine, for many parents of the approximately six million other children in the United States who have asthma — it’s hard to believe that this coronavirus, which targets lung cells, isn’t more dangerous to our kids. So I called Dr. Gwynne Church, M.D., a pediatric pulmonologist at University of California, San Francisco, Benioff Children’s Hospital. She admitted that almost all the research on the new coronavirus so far has been focused on what is leading to severe pneumonia and death, not its effect on common chronic diseases. “It’s reassuring that asthma was not a risk for death with the coronavirus in China,” she said. “But we don’t know that the virus wasn’t leading to sickness causing increased asthma.” It’s an evolving situation, she added, and our populations are not identical. For one thing, the reported rate for childhood asthma in China is lower than in the United States.",

    "article_text": "In two other posts, he also said:\n\n“CDC and my Administration are doing a GREAT job of handling Coronavirus, including the very early closing of our borders to certain areas of the world. It was opposed by the Dems, ‘too soon’, but turned out to be the correct decision. No matter how well we do, however, the Democrats talking point is that we are doing badly. If the virus disappeared tomorrow, they would say we did a really poor, and even incompetent, job. Not fair, but it is what it is. So far, by the way, we have not had one death. Let’s keep it that way!”\n\nAt a news conference, Mr. Trump was asked about his previous criticisms of the Obama administration’s handling of Ebola in 2014. He responded: “At that time, nobody had ever even heard of Ebola or ever conceived of something where you basically — the people would disintegrate. And we’re still working on Ebola.” He went on saying, “The level of death with Ebola — you know, at the time, it was a virtual hundred percent.”\n\nThis was exaggerated. Ebola got its name from a 1976 outbreak. The average fatality rate is around 50 percent, but has ranged from 27 percent in Sierra Leone during the 2014 to 2016 outbreak to 88 percent in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 1976. Ebola is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person, while the coronavirus can be transmitted more easily, through close contact or droplets from sneezes and coughs.\n\nFeb. 26\n\nCases are confirmed in more than 30 countries. Vice President Mike Pence is given the job of leading the coronavirus response in the U.S.\n\nAt a news conference at the White House, Mr. Trump addressed Democratic criticism of his response:\n\n“We should all be working together,” he said. He added: “All they’re trying to do is get a political advantage. This isn’t about political advantage. We’re all trying to do the right thing. They shouldn’t be saying: ‘This is terrible. President Trump isn’t asking for enough money.’ How stupid a thing to say. If they want to give us more money, that’s OK.”\n\nThe president responded to whether U.S. schools should prepare for the virus:\n\n“I think every aspect of our society should be prepared. I don’t think it’s going to come to that, especially with the fact that we’re going down, not up. We’re going very substantially down, not up. But, yeah, I think schools should be preparing and, you know, get ready just in case.” He added: “We have it so well under control. I mean, we really have done a very good job.”",

Names of femicide victims — more than 1,000 in 2019 — were painted across the main city plaza. The crime of femicide in Mexico is murder for reasons of gender, often committed by people known to the victim. It’s like a hate crime in the U.S., except here almost none of the murders are ever solved. The vast majority marched in peace. But there was an anarchist contingent. Male journalists were chased away. The all-female police force went to guard the doors to the National Palace when suddenly ... Women dressed in black threw plastic Molotov cocktails at police lines. A few of the injured were whisked away to ambulances. Is your arm OK? Did you get burned? Despite the bombs, the female police showed restraint. I didn’t see a single arrest.

    "article_text": "If India fails to fill these serious gaps in its capacity, the pandemic will exact a heavy toll.\n\nThe disease is likely to return later in the year. Many Indians still lack immunity to the coronavirus, although the extent will be known only when surveys are conducted that are able to test the population for antibodies that indicate their exposure to the disease.\n\nThe lockdown has most likely saved millions of lives, but the bold public health actions of the government should be matched by similar efforts to ensure that the pandemic does not generate a secondary hunger and poverty crisis. Nearly half a billion Indians earn daily wages and have no meaningful savings. The state governments of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Uttar Pradesh have already announced a daily minimum allowance and monthly rations to help families avert a hunger crisis. Others are likely to follow.\n\nOn Thursday, India’s finance minister announced a support package of $20.6 billion, which includes direct cash payments, free cooking gas, and food grains and lentils for the poor. Indian government has massive amounts of excess food stocks that could be used quickly to expand the public distribution system.\n\nTo some extent, demonetization has helped by moving parts of the economy to digital payments that now reach about 40 percent of the population. The push to direct benefits to where each adult has a bank account could help transfer emergency funds into the pockets of the poor, who will desperately need them to tide over the next few weeks and months.\n\nIndia’s health care system is about to be tested. The health workers, doctors, hospitals and public health professionals must prepare for the eventual onslaught of the contagion in late April or early May.\n\nMedical personnel around the country have complained about the lack of protective gear, which should be urgently addressed. Both the public and the private sectors will have to join forces. The next four weeks are absolutely crucial for India, and the lives and livelihoods of 1.4 billion Indians depend on the work that lies ahead.\n\nRamanan Laxminarayan is an economist and an epidemiologist.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended Sunday that no gatherings with 50 people or more be held in the United States for the next eight weeks.\n\nGermany announced it would close its borders with Austria, Denmark, France, Luxembourg and Switzerland, following several other European Union member states in restricting the freedom of movement across the Continent.\n\nThe Vatican said on Sunday that its traditional services during the week before Easter, which usually draw tens of thousands of people, would not be open to the public next month, interrupting a historic tradition. Ireland closed pubs for two weeks, including on St. Patrick’s Day, while Austria banned gatherings of more than five people.\n\nIn the United States, more than 3,100 cases of the virus have been reported across 49 states as of Sunday, and public officials scrambled to enact stricter measures to slow the virus’s spread, including the shuttering of schools, restaurants, bars and other businesses.\n\nNew York City’s public school system, the nation’s largest with 1.1 million students, will begin shutting down this week, Governor Andrew M.

But in mid-February, the agency announced that the tests were flawed, and should not be used. Instead, it told state health departments to send all samples to the central C.D.C. lab in Atlanta. That resulted in several days’ delay in getting results.\n\nThe testing glitch appeared to have occurred in scaling up the manufacturing of test kits.\n\nThe kits had three components but some of the components were producing an inconclusive result for many public health labs using the test. On Thursday, the agency announced that labs with two of three working components could go ahead and use the C.D.C. tests, and it broadened the criteria for testing to include people who had traveled to countries with coronavirus infections in addition to China. But positive results still needed to be reconfirmed by the C.D.C. in Atlanta, and labs with only one working component could not conduct tests at all.\n\n“Because of these limited resources, we could not get some of our patients tested,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.\n\nDr. Schaffner said he had a patient come in earlier this week who had developed symptoms of an upper respiratory infection after traveling to Italy, where a cluster of coronavirus infections has been observed.

There. clare toeniskoetter We just, rather than shaking hands, bumped elbows. donald g. mcneil jr. Yes, the W.H.O. elbow bump. You want to sit down? clare toeniskoetter Should I wash my hands? donald g. mcneil jr. Yeah. You probably should, as much for your protection as for mine. It depends on what you put your hands on. clare toeniskoetter I wanted to ask you. We heard you, yesterday, sanitizing the studio. What do you do when you come home? donald g. mcneil jr. I wash my hands. I know the inside of my house is clean, because the only people in here are my girlfriend and myself, and we’re both still healthy. But people who live upstairs — and this is a two-apartment building — we have agreed that we will tell each other if any of us has a fever or a cough, and we keep some alcohol wipes in the front hall to wipe down the doorknob, light switch, and other surfaces we might both touch, just to make sure that there’s no possibility of us passing it back and forth to each other. I know it sounds kooky, but this is actually the way the disease gets transmitted. You don’t have to be a crazy germaphobe. Or actually, at a time like this, it helps to be a crazy germaphobe just by instinct. And here. I’ll wash my hands in front of you so that you know that my hands are clean. But the danger with somebody else is, of course, that they’re coughing. But I’m not. I’m fine. clare toeniskoetter I’ve never been in someone’s home in these circumstances.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.” Today: Now that the coronavirus has gone from an epidemic to a pandemic, and both infections and deaths from the disease are surging across the world and the United States, we return to Times science reporter, Donald G. McNeil Jr., who has covered the story from the start, to understand how to navigate this new reality. It’s Friday, March 13. Hey, Donald.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nHey. How are you?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGood. Welcome back, and thank you for letting us into your home. I know we’ve been hearing a lot from you lately, so let us know if we’re beginning to exhaust your generosity.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nOK. So far, so good.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo far. Key word. Donald, when we first started talking to you about the coronavirus about two weeks ago, you gave us an overview of what it was, where it was headed. Since then, a lot has changed. Given the evolution of the situation, we have questions related to this new phase of the epidemic, now that it’s very much in our lives. I’m working from home. You’re working from home. So let’s start with questions about precautions for people who don’t have the virus — which, presumably, is the vast majority of us at the moment — and how we can protect ourselves from getting the virus. What kind of activities should be avoided right now?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYou have to be aware not only of people around you who are coughing, but you also have to be aware that every — basically every hard surface you touch might potentially have virus on it, unless you know it’s been cleaned since the last person that you don’t know was there might have been on it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLet me tick through a couple of what we imagine, from conversations with everybody on “The Daily” team at The Times, to be the kinds of scenarios I think people want to better understand how to approach. A bit of a lightning round here. Is it dangerous, at this moment, to keep going to work?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nLook, some people are going to have to go to work. Doctors have to go to work. But it’s not so much the danger. The reason the government’s asking people not to go to work is because it creates what they call social distancing. The less interactions there are between people, the less exchange of virus there is. If you slow down the virus, you change what is sometimes called R-naught. And if you get people to be more distant from each other, the virus is transmitted less.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCan you translate that phrase, R-naught?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYeah. It’s called the reproductive number of the virus. It’s, “If I’m sick, how many people am I going to infect?” You never know the real R-naught, or the real fatality rate, or anything about a disease, until it’s completely gone through the world. So we’re never going to know the real answers to these things for at least a year or two, because they’re going to be different in Africa than they are in New York. They’re going to be different anywhere. But if you create more distance between people so that I infect, hopefully, no people, you’ve substantially slowed my part of transmitting the virus. And if you do that across the entire population, you really slow down the movement of that virus in the population. When a lot of people are infected, and a lot of people have pneumonia, a lot of people all need to get to the hospital at the same time. A lot of those people need to get on oxygen or on ventilators, and eventually you run out of ventilators. Then you’re making the triage decisions that they’re now making in northern Italy, which is to say, OK, this is Donald McNeil, 66 years old. I’ve got a choice between saving him or a 25-year-old mother of two. Goodbye, Mr. McNeil. Sorry there isn’t any time for your family to say goodbye to you, because we can’t have visitors, but that’s it. See you later.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSheesh.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWhich is the right thing to do. That’s the right decision for a doctor to make. But those are really tough decisions for doctors.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLet me return to our lightning round that has not yet turned into a lightning round.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nSorry.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBased on some of what you just said, I’m intuiting where this may be headed, but — take the bus or the subway at this moment. Is that wise?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nI don’t think it’s terribly wise. I did it yesterday to get home. I ride the subway standing up with my face close to the vent. I have one glove on my hand, one gardening glove, and I use that if I have to hold onto a rail. The other hand, I make sure, never touches a surface, and I use that for my phone. Mostly, I keep it in my pocket. And I won’t get into a crowded car. I’ll let the train go by.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut if you don’t have to take the subway.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nIf you don’t have to take the subway, don’t.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nStaying on this theme — lots of people are curious about plane travel.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nI would avoid plane travel if I could help it. I have friends who were about to fly to Kentucky to visit their son, and I said, you know what? Why don’t you drive? You know where all the surfaces inside your car have been. You don’t know where all the surfaces inside that plane or that airport have been. I know it’s going to be 11 hours instead of two hours, but I’d say, do it. And that’s what they’re doing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHow about trips to familiar retail establishments — a grocery store, a restaurant?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWell, you have to have food, so go to the grocery store. Be super careful about the handle of the cart, and remember that every box you touch has been placed on that shelf by somebody who might have coughed into their hand. Now, restaurants — I did eat in a restaurant a couple of nights ago. We looked for one that was, really, pretty empty, and we sat at the bar which had just been wiped down. But as this pandemic progresses, I’ll worry more, and I’ll probably avoid going into restaurants.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe gym.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYeah, the gym. I go to a gym. I play squash, which means all I have to touch in common with the other player is the ball, and I know my partner. I would be real reluctant to start grabbing a bunch of weights, not knowing who else had touched them, grabbing a bunch of handles on machines, not knowing who had touched them. I would be reluctant to play basketball with a dozen other guys, because you can’t have 10 guys handling the same ball. If one of them is spewing virus, a virus is going to get on the ball, and then everybody’s got it on their hands.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHow about movies, concerts — things that might be open-air, but where people are sitting quite close to each other?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nOpen-air is safer than enclosed, but even in open-air venues, if you’re sitting on a seat, the handles of the seat might have virus on them. The railings when you walk down to your seat might have virus on them. The ticket taker, as he takes your ticket and hands it back to you — I know it’s paranoid-sounding, but these are all the ways that virus can be transmitted in large gatherings. It’s not just the coughing. It’s the many surfaces that get touched.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn general, I’m hearing you say that going out and interacting with other people poses risks. So I wonder if you can help us understand the calculations behind your thinking in these particular categories. Does it have to do with the lifespan of the virus? Does it have to do with recommendations around social distancing? What is the underlying logic?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes. They’re related to all these things. But I think people get way too obsessive about numbers, about exactly how many hours or days does the virus live on a surface? Exactly how many feet do you have to stand away from somebody else? I mean, you can’t run around through life with a tape measure, trying to figure out, is 3 feet safe enough? Is 6 feet safe enough? But stay away from people who are coughing. Stay away from people who look feverish. And if you have to communicate with somebody, keep your distance. That’s what I’d say. Just generally keep your distance.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou’ve talked about social distancing. How do you socially distance yourself from your family, from your children, from your partner, your spouse, your boyfriend, your girlfriend? Does that really work?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYou can’t. My girlfriend and I still kiss each other. We just trust each other enough to believe we’re not infected. It’s impossible to socially distance yourself from your children. They’re going to come up and hug you. That’s why the whole idea of home quarantine — home isolation, rather — is virtually impossible.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDonald, there’s a strong sense that very young people and people in their teens, 20s, early 30s, are at a much lower risk level for the coronavirus. And I think that’s been borne out. Correct me if I’m wrong. So do all the recommendations that we keep hearing apply as stringently to the young?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes, unless you’re totally selfish.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat you mean?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nDo you have a parent? Do you have a grandparent? Do you want to be the vector that carries that disease to them? Do you know anybody and love anybody who’s older and might be frail? You don’t want your last memory of that person — being that you gave them the virus that killed them. You’ll kick yourself for the rest of your life if you did that. People who were hospitalized in China started at age 30 and went up to 70s and 80s. Yes, on average, the outcomes are better. But if you want something to worry about, you might be the person who doesn’t have a good outcome. You’re spreading a disease to your friends, your social circle. That’s something you ought to feel guilty about. It’s not something you ought to feel indifferent about. People have to take this seriously.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back. We’ve been talking about precautions for people who don’t have the virus and want to keep it that way. I want to turn, now, to what happens if you think you might have the virus. Based on your reporting, and based on the publicly available information, what are the first signs of illness that have been reported and that people, therefore, could be looking out for?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nWhat the Chinese found in the large study of the first 45,000 cases is that it’s not like a cold. Fever is the number-one sign. High fever, a dry cough, and then, after that, fatigue. Runny nose was only 4% of cases, and those people might have had flu or a cold at the same time. But there’s something I wanted to say that was important. I described, in our first interview, that 80% of all cases were mild, and the other 20% were either severe or critical. And that stuck in too many people’s minds as if, oh, 80% of cases are practically nothing. You don’t even have it. Maybe it’s asymptomatic. No. That’s wrong. The Chinese study that was based on — everything was either mild, severe, or critical. Mild included everything from “barely any symptoms” to pneumonia, but pneumonia not needing hospitalization or oxygen. Once you stepped over into needing oxygen, then you were severe. Once you were in organ failure, you were critical. So if people think this is a mild disease, get over that idea. I’m sorry if I contributed to the spread of that idea. I should have been much more careful in describing the whole range of symptoms that came under the term “mild.”\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. In other words, “mild” doesn’t necessarily mean mild.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nNothing like what we mean by a mild cold.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhen is it recommended that, no matter how mild or severe the symptoms are, a person be tested? Is there a threshold?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nI don’t know if the authorities have set a threshold yet. I know what happens in pandemics is that, ultimately, you have to assume that a lot of people have the disease. And that really when you reach the point where almost everybody has it, you end up stopping even bothering to test them. You ultimately are going to assume that everybody has it, because it’s the most popular virus going around. If you have no trouble breathing, if you have got a fever that you can handle at home, then stay home and take care of it. Although that’s not the way the Chinese handled it. The Chinese said, if you think you have symptoms — and I hope we get to this point. The Chinese said, if you think you have symptoms, if you think you’re getting sick, get directed to a fever clinic, where somebody who is in protective gear can see you, and they will see you and sort out whether you have bacterial pneumonia, or flu, or whether you have coronavirus. And if you have coronavirus, you’re going to go into isolation with a lot of other people who have coronavirus. Even if you have a very mild case, you’re going to go in with all the other mild cases, because they know cases can crash. It’s a pretty common phenomenon that people are going along OK with some breathing difficulty, and then in the second week, they crash. Their oxygen saturation drops, and they need oxygen. And in those cases, in the isolation centers in China, when you might be in a gymnasium with 1,000 other people, when you crashed, they recognized it right there. There was no wait, and they would move you to a hospital.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThis is a bit of an ethics question, but let’s say you get into a cab, and you’re on your way to get tested for the coronavirus, or you hitch a ride with a friend. Should it be disclosed that you think you might have the virus? Should basically anyone you come in contact with be aware of your status?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes. You’re carrying a potentially lethal disease, so you’ve got to warn other people. There’s no ethical question about this. Unfortunately, this has been the story of I don’t know how many pandemics. How many people have lied about having a sexually transmitted disease, especially in the five minutes right before they thought they were going to get lucky, and if they disclosed what they had, they were going to ruin the moment? Unfortunately, that’s how a whole lot of sexually transmitted diseases, including H.I.V., get passed on. It takes a lot of courage to be that ethical, and I hope during this epidemic, people will.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd the test itself, it remains somewhat scarce, but to the degree you know it, can you describe the test? Is it a saliva swab?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThe point is to get a sample of where the virus is, so there are different ways of getting that swab. Typically, for a while, they were doing nasopharyngeal swabs, which is, basically, pushing a Q-tip so far up your nose that it feels like it’s going into your brain. But I’ve seen swabs that were just taken from the back of the throat. And I know that there are some times, when people are coughing hard, they try to get them to cough up sputum so they can test that. You want to get a sample that’s got virus from where the cells are infected. Originally, it attaches deep in the lungs, so you’re trying to get a sample from there. But once it moves up into your nose and throat, maybe you can get a sample from there. So it’s very dangerous for the person who’s trying to get the Q-tip in, or the sputum sample out, to be standing right in front of them as they do that. They have to be really protected in order to do that safely.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHow long do the results generally seem to be taking for these tests?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nI was told that, in China, when they had the on-the-spot labs and the fever clinics, they could give you an answer in as little as four hours, but that’s ideal. There were others of seven hours. Other times, they had to send it off someplace overnight. Until recently, we’ve been having to send every sample to Atlanta. So that’s several days.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. To the C.D.C.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYes, to the C.D.C.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhich is the least efficient version of this, it would seem.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nIt’s the least efficient version, but for a while, it was the only accurate version, and a positive wasn’t considered a positive until the C.D.C. had confirmed it. We’ve got to solve this testing problem. We’ve got to have it so that tests are literally right there, because you’ve got to diagnose people and then isolate them so they don’t go home and give the virus to the family, and they don’t go back to work and give the virus to their coworkers.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd we are not at that phase just yet, are we?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nRight now, we’re not even talking about that phase. That’s how they did it in China. Right now, we’re still talking about home isolation, and the W.H.O., the Chinese, and the South Koreans would say, that doesn’t work. That’s too dangerous. There’s no way you can isolate at home without infecting your family.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe final phase of questions, Donald, are, what happens when a person has been diagnosed with the virus? You’ve told us that there really is no cure for the coronavirus. It’s going to run its course. Are there useful over-the-counter medicines that would help somebody get through this virus?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThis is kind of crazy, because I don’t think it’s safe to think of it as something you can happily stay home with and treat like, oh, I’ve got the flu. You’ve got to be aware that there is the possibility of crashing. You’ve got to have a number you can call. The state should be aware that you’re a patient, that you’re in home quarantine, and there should be somebody checking in on you each day, or you should be checking in with somebody so that they say, how high is your fever? How fast are you breathing?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHow long can a person expect to be sick, once diagnosed?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nMild cases typically resolved themselves in two weeks. People who were on ventilators and in severe situations were usually three to six weeks.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat’s a long time.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nYeah. That’s a long time. It’s a long time for one of your ventilators to be in use. Even the severe and the critical cases — most of the time, they ended in good outcomes. But for some people, death took several weeks, too. People didn’t just immediately crash and die. It would be a somewhat slow process.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDonald, once you have this virus, does it confer immunity on getting the coronavirus again in the next couple weeks, next couple of years, forever?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nNobody knows about forever. Virtually all doctors assume that having recovered from this confers immunity, because that’s the norm. When you recover from a disease, you normally have immunity at least for a while.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOnce a person recovers from the virus, is there permanent damage? Do we know?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nSome people who have gone into severe pneumonia or A.R.D.S., adult respiratory distress syndrome, yes, will have permanent damage. They’ll live, but they’ll have permanently damaged lungs. That can definitely happen.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what do we know about how the virus, long-term, affects people who I think would be, justifiably, quite anxious at this moment — pregnant women?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThe small numbers of women that have been studied in China who were pregnant during this relatively short time period — there was a study that came out just a couple of days ago. Nine women all delivered healthy babies. Something like six of the women were delivered by cesarean, which doctors may have chosen to do just for the extra safety of knowing that the baby wasn’t going to be infected in the birth canal. But some of the babies were born naturally, too, and all the babies were healthy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat’s reassuring.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThat’s good news it’s a very small sample, but it’s good news from what we know from the small sample. It’s really different from some other diseases.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFinally, Donald, we want to tackle a few questions that we’ve observed from friends, family and from the internet that may be in the territory of rumor or half-baked theories, but that are gaining some currency. So basically, a true-or-false section here. First off, are there multiple strains of the coronavirus, and are some more dangerous than others?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nNo. There are slightly different variants of the coronavirus — really, variances by a couple of nucleotides. There is no evidence that one is more infectious than the other, or one is more lethal than the other. Not so far, anyway.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNext. This is a seasonal virus, and it will more or less be gone in a few months.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThat would be lovely, but we don’t know that. This is a new virus. We’ve never seen it in summertime, so we don’t know how it’s going to behave in summertime. Respiratory viruses like influenza tend to disappear in the summer. We don’t know what this virus is going to do in the summer, so it’s not a good idea to make predictions. That’s just wishful thinking on the part of people who say, oh, it’s all going to disappear in the summertime.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd the last of these true-of-false questions, Donald. Are the media — we hear this a lot — blowing the scale of this out of proportion, given the relatively small number of infections compared with the overall populations in any given country?\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nLook. I ask myself this question every day, because I’m the media in this case. Normally, I get to blame the other jackals of the press for blowing things out of proportion, but this time —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNot this time.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\n— it’s on my shoulders. I’d like to think there’s nothing to worry about. I never worried about Ebola coming to New York. I never worried much about SARS spreading in New York. I worried, in the beginning, about H1N1 flu in 2009, but then, as the mortality data got clearer, I stopped worrying. I knew we’d mostly get it, but I knew it would be, mostly, not a problem. This one, same as I said two-plus weeks ago, really flips me out. This one reminds me of 1918 — a dangerous virus that transmits easily between people. Yes, 80% of the cases are mild, but as I described, “mild” is a term that the Chinese use describing all the way up to pneumonia. That’s not mild. We don’t know what the fatality rate is. It got as high, in some weeks in Wuhan, as 5%. That was during the chaos period in Wuhan. We don’t know what it is in Italy now, and we won’t know, until it’s all over, what the total fatality rate is going to be. I’d love to be told I was wrong, I was an alarmist, I should eat my hat. But we’ll see. So far, I’ve been right about every scary thing I said about this disease. I’ve been worried, ever since I looked at the numbers, about how fast the epidemic was doubling in China, and how fast people were going to hospitals. I sat down and wrote down on a piece of paper about how fast this could double, and I came into work the next day and said, this is going to go pandemic. Originally, nobody believed me, and I had to call 12 different experts and count which ones believed me and which ones didn’t believe me. It came out, basically, eight to two to two. Eight thought it —\n\n[music]\n\n— had the potential to go pandemic, two thought it was overblown, and two didn’t want to comment, didn’t want to take a guess.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like you’re saying, so far, we haven’t blown it out of proportion, and you have been a relatively successful prognosticator of this virus. So that’s why we’re going to keep talking to you about it. I want to tell you how much I appreciate you giving us your time and your wisdom. Thank you.\n\ndonald g. mcneil jr.\n\nThank you for inviting me.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOver the coming weeks, we’ll be answering your questions about the coronavirus and how to navigate the pandemic. You can send us your questions by voicemail at 646-598-6012. Be sure to tell us your name and where you’re calling from. We’ll be right back.\n\n[music]",

The United States was stoking fear and panic, a spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said. “True feeling shines through in hardship,” she said back then.\n\nNow China is doing the same, undercutting its own diplomatic efforts to win sympathy and support by imposing travel restrictions that it once called unnecessary. They include 14 days of quarantine for travelers from Italy, Iran, South Korea and Japan. Almost everyone flying into Beijing faces a similar fate, regardless of departure point.\n\n“They have a toolbox that only seems to have a hammer,” said Jörg Wuttke, the president of the European Chamber of Commerce in China, who is now himself in quarantine in his Beijing home after returning from Europe last Friday.",

    "article_text": "In December, a woman in Tulsa, Okla., used a Craigslist post to plea for holiday companionship. “Anybody need a grandma for Christmas?” she wrote. “I’ll even bring food and gifts for the kids! I have nobody and it really hurts.” More than three in five working Americans report feeling lonely. Now that the country is facing a disease outbreak that demands measures like “social distancing,” working from home and quarantines, that epidemic of loneliness could get even worse.\n\nA paradox of this moment is that while social distancing is required to contain the spread of the coronavirus, it may also contribute to poor health in the long run. So while physical isolation will be required for many Americans who have Covid-19 or have been exposed to it, it’s important that we don’t let such measures cause social and emotional isolation, too.\n\nThe Health Resources and Services Administration cautions that loneliness can be as damaging to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Feelings of isolation and loneliness can increase the likelihood of depression, high blood pressure, and death from heart disease. They can also affect the immune system’s ability to fight infection — a fact that’s especially relevant during a pandemic. Studies have shown that loneliness can activate our fight-or-flight function, causing chronic inflammation and reducing the body’s ability to defend itself from viruses.\n\nAcross the country, people are being asked to work from home, universities are switching to virtual classes and large gatherings are being canceled. These are key strategies to prevent transmission, but they can come at a social and mental-health cost: furthering our sense of isolation from one another, and making us forget that we’re in this together.",

    "article_text": "Another New York Times article “Doing Little or Doing More Looks Like This” focuses on different levels of intervention and its effect on infection and death rates. The mathematical model behind this dynamic graph predicts that even with moderate interventions, the death rate can be cut in half. Note that the results of this model are very sensitive to many variables including the distribution of the age of the population, fatality rate, replication rate (number of infected persons per person infected), and hospital capacity. Different assumptions for any of these variables may result in very different outcomes.\n\nThere is another New York Times article “Which Country Has Flattened the Curve for the Coronavirus?” which shows time series graphs of the number of new cases by date for the 73 countries which have more than 50 confirmed cases. (Note that the scales on the graphs vary to make them more readable. For example, the y-axis scale for Vietnam is 0 - 6 new cases, while the scale for Italy is 0 - 3,000 new cases.) You can compare countries’ trajectories of new coronavirus cases. Some countries, including Japan and Korea, have had coordinated national programs of vigilant monitoring and interventions, including travel bans and mandatory quarantines for returning travelers, that have resulted in downturns in the number of new cases.\n\nHow should the United States “flatten the curve?”\n\nThis week, we moderated our five hours and had 654 responses from around the world with over 200 great headlines. Thanks to all students who responded. And, just as importantly, to the students who replied to other students. You made this a community in these times of school closings and social isolation. Here is a small group of catchy headlines that capture the main idea of this graph: “Corona’s Tradeoff: How a Longer ‘Coronacation’ will Prevent Deaths” By Evan of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, “Coronavirus: Protecting More Than Just Our Health.” By Jenna of Pennsylvania, “Refuse Quarantine and We All Suffer the Consequences” by Emily of Melrose High School in Massachusetts, and “Protect Our Healthcare System by Protecting Yourself” by Lilly of New York.\n\nYou may want to think critically about these questions.\n\nBy implementing protective measures, like social distancing and closures of schools and businesses, why would the number of cases at any one-time decrease compared to when there are no protective measures? Why would the length of the epidemic increase when protective measures are implemented?\n\nWhat interventions could be instituted to change the outcomes shown in this graph? Break down your response into what could change the length of the epidemic (“time since first case”), number of infected people (“# of cases”), and number of infected patients that could be treated (“health care system capability”). Which of these changes would be easiest and which would be hardest to implement?\n\nA simulation is a mathematical process that models random events. A random event is an event that is not predictable; that is, you cannot predict its occurrence exactly. Good simulations closely resemble real-world outcomes. The Washington Post published a simulation of the spread of the coronavirus under four levels of intervention: no intervention, forced quarantine, and two levels of social distancing. In the dynamic simulation, you can see the infected members of the population interacting with others, either by staying clear of others or infecting them. The simulations show how the number of healthy, recovered, and sick individuals changes over time. View the article and see the results of these four levels of intervention. Are the curves in the graphs based on the simulations symmetrical as they are in the New York Times graph? If not, why do you think they are not symmetrical? Based on what you see in the simulations, what amount of intervention do you support?\n\nBelow in the Stat Nuggets, we define and explain mathematical terms that apply to the graph.\n\nThank you for participating in “What’s Going On in This Graph?” which is intended to help you think more critically about graphs and the underlying data. Critical thinking is an essential element of statistics, the science of learning from data.",

    "article_text": "Scientists tracking the spread of the coronavirus reported on Monday that, for every confirmed case, there are most likely another five to 10 people in the community with undetected infections. These often-milder cases are, on average, about half as infectious as confirmed ones, but are responsible for nearly 80 percent of new cases, according to the report, which was based on data from China.\n\nThe researchers modeled the virus’s natural spread in China before the government instituted a travel ban and an aggressive testing policy. During that time, from December of last year through late January, about 6 in 7 cases went undetected. That situation is analogous to the current state of affairs in the United States and other Western countries, where tests are not widely available, the researchers said.\n\n“If we have 3,500 confirmed cases in the U.S., you might be looking at 35,000 in reality,” said Jeffrey Shaman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University and the senior author of the new report, which was posted by the journal Science.\n\nThe report is among the first to address two of the most pressing questions about the pandemic: How many people are walking around with unrecognized infections, and how infectious are they? As American policymakers have begun taking more aggressive measures to slow transmission, such as canceling events and closing restaurants, access to tests for the virus has been difficult or nonexistent in much of the country.",

Here, off the bustling Paseo de la Reforma, there’s an unsettling sense of normalcy. Flight attendants, newly arrived from the United States, walk around carefree. “I think on the one hand, it’s refreshing for us because we’re coming from a place that’s taking extreme precautions. We are on a petri dish most of the time, so I might already be exposed — more likely on the plane than probably here.” Mexico has documented four deaths from Covid-19. One man died after attending a large music concert. Doctors say the virus is already spreading in the community. “We don’t have tests, so we are having low numbers of patients that are infected.” Dr. Francisco Moreno oversees nine Covid patients at Mexico City’s ABC Hospital. He’s self-isolating, so I interviewed him remotely. “Do you think Mexico could be as bad as Italy?” But Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has continued to say there is no cause for alarm, and resists the measures other countries have taken to slow the virus’s spread. This was his message in early March. López Obrador, also known as AMLO, has continued to hold political rallies around Mexico, shaking hands and hugging admirers. Other government officials may encourage social distancing, but he asks people to go out and spend their pesos. But according to a recent O.E.C.D. report, Mexico has fewer nurses and fewer intensive care beds per capita than Italy, South Korea and the U.S. A count of ventilators in state facilities revealed only about 2,050 machines in the entire country. International leaders have criticized López Obrador’s response to the crisis as irresponsible. The president of El Salvador even begged Mexico, via Twitter, to take more drastic measures so as not to become the next epicenter of the pandemic.",

But about 20 percent of people become more seriously ill and in about 2 percent of patients in China, which has had the most cases, the disease has been fatal.\n\nThe disease can seriously sicken adults of all ages. According to a report of the first recorded cases in the United States, young, previously healthy adults can develop severe symptoms that could require ventilators and other life support. These patients may have a better chance at survival. Older, frailer people, or those with underlying health issues, like diabetes or another chronic illness, face the greater likelihood of dying from the virus.\n\nIn China, Dr. Xiao conducted pathological examinations of two people who went into a hospital in Wuhan in January for a different reason — they needed surgery for early stage lung cancer — but whose records later showed that they had also had coronavirus infection, which the hospital did not recognize at the time. Neither patient’s lung cancer was advanced enough to kill them, he said.\n\nOne of those patients, an 84-year-old woman with diabetes, died from pneumonia caused by coronavirus, Dr. Xiao said the records showed.",

They cautioned that such steps carried enormous costs that could also affect people’s health, but concluded they were “the only viable strategy at the current time.”\n\nThat is because different steps, intended to drive down transmission by isolating patients, quarantining those in contact with them and keeping the most vulnerable apart from others for three months, could only cut the predicted death toll by half, the new report said.\n\nThe White House guidelines urged Americans to avoid gatherings of more than 10 people. That is a more restrictive stance than recommendations released on Sunday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which said that gatherings should be limited to 50.",

    "article_text": "[Bagpipe music] There are moments that seem bizarre, moments of fear … … preparation and moments of emptiness. These are scenes from the world living with coronavirus. It has spread across cultures, languages and even out to sea. And despite these global differences, a number of shared experiences have emerged. There is grief over the dead. In Iran, hospital staff mourn a doctor’s death from the virus. In China, a quarantined building collapses, and a firefighter breaks down after pulling bodies from the rubble. In Italy, a man mourns the death of his sister. To try and save lives, authorities take precautions. They disinfect public areas and screen populations. “This is just crazy. Around the world, people are afraid and on edge. “Unbelievable.” In Northern Ireland, routine construction work at an Apple Store is mistaken for virus-related activity. In Japan, tempers flare when a man sneezes on a train. One Italian takes the fear and adds humor. This is a circle to keep people at a safe distance. In fact, lots of people use humor to cope with the uncertainty or the stigma of being sick. In Australia, a run on toilet paper leads to lessons in self-defense. “He’s going to show you how to deal with people stealing your toilet paper.” There is also defiance, a conviction that life must go on despite the virus. Across rooftops in China, quarantined neighbors socialize. From a rooftop in Italy, a theater group performs poetry for an area where movement is restricted. On a quarantined cruise ship, there’s songwriting to pass the time. In an apartment in China, too. But perhaps some of the most striking moments from the pandemic are those where little happens: the empty streets. “Unbelievable. No traffic.” The quiet airports. The places of worship without worshippers. Stores without goods. This is how it is across the globe as we prepare, grieve and wait for the next chapter of the coronavirus.",

    "article_text": "What’s at stake in this coronavirus pandemic? How many Americans can become infected? How many might die?\n\nThe answers depend on the actions we take — and, crucially, on when we take them. Working with infectious disease epidemiologists, we developed this interactive tool that lets you see what may lie ahead in the United States and how much of a difference it could make if officials act quickly. (The figures are for America, but the lessons are broadly applicable to any country.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we stay on the current track, this model predicts that roughly a third of Americans – more than 100 million people — could become infected (including more than nine million at one time). Other estimates are higher, up to two-thirds, but even in this scenario, one million could die. But interventions matter hugely. Ending public gatherings, closing workplaces and some schools, mass testing and fortifying hospitals keep infection rates down and reduce deaths. Here’s that same scenario but shifted so that the interventions begin one month later. The number of infections climbs by more than two million. So it’s not just intervening that’s important — it’s intervening quickly. Yesterday is better than today, which is better than tomorrow. Try it yourself by dragging the intervention bar on the chartslider below to the left or right to change when interventions are put in place. Adjust intervention start date: Aggressiveness matters, too. Adjust the severity of the interventions below to see why: Aggressive measures include widespread testing and ending large gatherings, while mild measures are essentially the status quo (although some places are instituting tougher measures). What matters is not only the total number of infections but also whether many occur at once. Overloaded hospitals and shortages of ventilators in intensive care units would result in people dying unnecessarily from the coronavirus as well as from heart attacks and other ailments. So successful interventions are crucial because they flatten the curve: We are much better off if the 100 million infections occur over 18 months rather than over 18 weeks. Here’s the same number of I.C.U. cases as before, but modeled to occur at a much slower rate.\n\nAny disease model is only as good as the assumptions programmed into it, and there’s so much uncertainty about the coronavirus that we shouldn’t see this model as a precise prediction.\n\nOne fundamental unknown is whether warmer weather will help reduce infections, as happens with the seasonal flu. If so, we could see a respite this summer, and then a resumption of cases in the fall (that’s what happened in 1918 with the Spanish flu pandemic). In addition, there are a number of treatments that are being tested and may prove helpful against the coronavirus.\n\n[For more analysis of global events that affect your life and a behind-the-scenes look at Nick Kristof's journalism, sign up for his newsletter.]\n\nOn the other hand, shortages of protective equipment like masks and chaos in hospitals may lead to higher death rates; the United States also has an older and thus more vulnerable population than China, from which much of the data comes.\n\n“The point of a model like this is not to try to predict the future but to help people understand why we may need to change our behaviors or restrict our movements, and also to give people a sense of the sort of effect these changes can have,” said Ashleigh Tuite, an epidemiologist at the University of Toronto who helped us develop this model. “When we have a new disease introduced in a population, we don’t have the benefit of immunity or vaccines to limit spread, but that doesn’t mean that we can’t control it,” she added. “Other countries have already shown that a strong response can bend the epidemic curve.”\n\nPresident Trump announced some steps on Wednesday to address the coronavirus, but they focused on the economy and on sharply reducing travel from most of Europe. At this point we may already have tens of thousands of infections in the United States — no one knows, because testing has been catastrophically bungled — and the number of cases is probably doubling every six days or so. In these circumstances, stopping a few new cases from Europe may not matter so much.\n\nPublic health specialists say we need a huge expansion of testing, major curbs on public gatherings, suspension of school in affected areas and intensive preparations so that hospitals can still function as infections soar. (We’ve recommended these and other crucial steps here).\n\nDavid N. Fisman, another University of Toronto epidemiologist who helped us assemble this model, noted that the challenge is that aggressive interventions must be put in place early to be most effective — and yet early in an epidemic the public may not be concerned enough to embrace such measures.\n\n“Early in the epidemic it is very difficult to muster the political will to implement costly, disruptive disease-control policies,” Dr. Fisman said. “What we are hoping to show here is that the calculus is one of short-term pain for long-term gain: Early, aggressive social distancing can substantially reduce the toll of epidemics, which can include the near collapse of health care systems, as we’re currently seeing in Italy.”\n\nWe’ll be honest: We worried that the clean lines in the graphics here risk suggesting a false precision. None of us know what lies ahead. But the wise uncertainty of epidemiologists is preferable to the confident bluster of television blowhards. The one thing we can be confident of is that enormous risks lie ahead — including a huge loss of life — if we don’t take aggressive action.\n\nWe have already squandered weeks in which the president scoffed at the coronavirus and tried to talk up the stock markets, but it’s not too late: We can still change the course of this epidemic.",

    "article_text": "These are days that test every leader — local, state and national. They are each being asked to make huge life and death decisions, while driving through a fog, with imperfect information, and everyone in the back seat shouting at them. My heart goes out to them all. I know they mean well. But as so many of our businesses shut down and millions begin to be laid off, some experts are beginning to ask: “Wait a minute! What the hell are we doing to ourselves? To our economy? To our next generation? Is this cure — even for a short while — worse than the disease?’’\n\nI share these questions. Our leaders are not flying completely blind: They are working off the advice of serious epidemiologists and public health experts. Yet we still need to be careful about “group think,’’ which is a natural but dangerous reaction when responding to a national and global crisis. We’re making decisions that affect the whole country and our entire economy — therefore, small errors in navigation could have huge consequences.\n\nOf course, because this virus is potentially affecting so many Americans at once, we need to provide more hospital beds, treatment equipment for those who will need it and protective gear like N95 masks for the doctors and nurses caring for virus-infected patients. That is urgent! And we need to immediately rectify the colossal failure to supply rapid, widespread testing. That is urgent!\n\nBut we also need to be asking ourselves — just as urgently — can we more surgically minimize the threat of this virus to those most vulnerable while we maximize the chances for as many Americans as possible to safely go back to work as soon as possible. One expert I talk to below believes that could happen in as early as a few weeks — if we pause for a moment and think afresh about the coronavirus challenge.",

It is unclear how long the new coronavirus can survive on surfaces, but studies of other such viruses have found they can stay active for a week or more.\n\nOn Thursday, a Japanese health ministry official said two infected passengers who were quarantined on the ship had died.

    "article_text": "In the end, the most honest answer to the question of why the Covid-19 virus is killing thousands of people, why infectious diseases ravage humanity and why there is suffering at all is: We don’t know. For me, this is the most honest and accurate answer. One could also suggest how viruses are part of the natural world and in some way contribute to life, but this approach fails abjectly when speaking to someone who has lost a friend or loved one. An important question for the believer in times of suffering is this: Can you believe in a God that you don’t understand?\n\nBut if the mystery of suffering is unanswerable, where can the believer go in times like this? For the Christian and perhaps even for others the answer is Jesus.\n\nChristians believe that Jesus is fully divine and fully human. Yet we sometimes overlook the second part. Jesus of Nazareth was born into a world of illness. In her book “Stone and Dung, Oil and Spit,” about daily life in first-century Galilee, Jodi Magness, a scholar of early Judaism, calls the milieu in which Jesus lived “filthy, malodorous and unhealthy.” John Dominic Crossan and Jonathan L. Reed, scholars of the historical background of Jesus, sum up these conditions in a sobering sentence in “Excavating Jesus”: “A case of the flu, a bad cold, or an abscessed tooth could kill.” This was Jesus’s world.\n\nMoreover, in his public ministry, Jesus continually sought out those who were sick. Most of his miracles were healings from illnesses and disabilities: debilitating skin conditions (under the rubric of “leprosy”), epilepsy, a woman’s “flow of blood,” a withered hand, “dropsy,” blindness, deafness, paralysis. In these frightening times, Christians may find comfort in knowing that when they pray to Jesus, they are praying to someone who understands them not only because he is divine and knows all things, but because he is human and experienced all things.\n\nBut those who are not Christian can also see him as a model for care of the sick. Needless to say, when caring for someone with coronavirus, one should take the necessary precautions in order not to pass on the infection. But for Jesus, the sick or dying person was not the “other,” not one to be blamed, but our brother and sister. When Jesus saw a person in need, the Gospels tell us that his heart was “moved with pity.” He is a model for how we are to care during this crisis: with hearts moved by pity.\n\nWhenever I prayed in that church near 68th and York, I would pause before a statue of Jesus, his arms outstretched, his heart exposed. Just a plaster statue, it wasn’t great art, but it was meaningful to me. I don’t understand why people are dying, but I can follow the person who gives me a pattern for life.\n\nJames Martin is a Jesuit priest, editor at large of America magazine, consultor to the Vatican’s Dicastery for Communication and the author of “Jesus: A Pilgrimage.”\n\nThe Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

And I’m thinking, That is so not true.” “It was just interesting, because there was this kind of gray area for a while of people who felt like they were really sick and should have been tested just as, even as a rule out. And the state of Washington just did not have the capacity to do that, because the government had not supported us at that point essentially.” “I got through to public health after about an hour, and they told me that I did not meet the criteria for being tested.” “They said, ‘There’s no way to get tested. We don’t have tests right now. There’s nothing set up in Delaware.’” “I looked at the C.D.C. website and it said, call your doctor if you have the symptoms. So I called the doctor’s office and they told me to go to an urgent care facility. I called an urgent care facility and they said that there’s nothing that they can do. And they don’t have the tests. And they told me to go to the E.R. And I called a hospital, and they told me that they don’t have the test either.” “I just felt like I was getting the run-around. It was clearly obvious that they just are under capacity, and they’re not able to test.” “I eventually just gave up because, at that point, the testing criteria was so strict. It was, you travel to China or have you been in contact with someone known diagnosed Covid. And I didn’t meet any of that.” “As a nurse in an E.R., it’s pretty vital if I have an infectious disease that I know what it is because I could be spreading it to people who are really vulnerable.” “I actually work in a building that’s a fairly public place. There’s people of every generation coming in there. There’s a private school there. There’s a senior center.” “Southwest Florida is full of elders. There is a lot of snowbirds coming here. They’re all in their 70s and 80s. I cannot get myself, like I cannot convince my conscience to leave the house just thinking about that, Hey you went grocery shopping and now like five people died. So I just self quarantined myself and basically started working from home.” “We stocked up on food items as much as possible. I bought a 25 pound bag of rice. We bought beans. We got ready basically just to hunker down for those two weeks. At this point, I’m telling people like make — if you have a decision to make, think about survival and make the decision based on survival for yourself, your family and your community.” “We knew this was coming. The federal government is just completely bungling this, and our lives are at stake. I feel like they’re just leaving us here to die in Seattle.” “The most overwhelming feeling was you are on your own.” “I’m just really concerned for those that this is going to affect the hardest.

It is not the first time.\n\nCalamities and the mass destruction of populations and lives stretch back to biblical times and on through the days of plague in medieval Europe. Wars, too, have brought a Darwinian pruning of entire societies. Technological advance, from siege engines to long bows, from gas chambers to weapons of mass destruction, has magnified the process, culminating in the Cold War’s calculations of mutually assured destruction.\n\nBut, as these photographs show — and as the pre-photographic chronicles of history, faith and mythology confirm — the Earth and its people have long been prey to the invisible pathogens that bring their victims low with equal efficiency.\n\nIn the annals of conflict, dating to the Plague of Athens from 430 to 426 BC during the Peloponnesian War, disease molded national fates as much as — sometimes more than — competing armies.",

    "article_text": "“We’re going to put out an executive order today. New York State on pause — only essential businesses will be functioning. 100% of the workforce must stay home. This is the most drastic action we can take.” “Everything is uncharted territory. Nobody knows what’s going to happen in the news any minute.” “I think I’ve been asking a lot of how we could have prevented this.” “Am I going to see another depression like my grandfather saw in the 1920s?” “Over the past few days, New York City has taken a lot of important measures. I’m just worried it came a little bit too late.” “I think I’m scared of having to see more death and from reading stories from abroad, having to make decisions about resources. And I’m worried people in my life are going to die from it. A few days ago, I had to watch a patient basically slowly die. I just felt helpless. This is the first time I’ve really seen people that I truly don’t know how to help. And they are coming in so sick that everything I’m used to doing to be able to treat them, I can’t really do.” “How was your day off, Mich?” “It was emotional, to say the least.” “Why?” “It’s just, like, the hospital has been insane. And every hour, like, things are changing. So it’s just, like, trying to keep up with that while trying to read about what I should be treating these people with, while people are rolling in the worst — I don’t know. They say in 18 days it’s supposed to get really bad. I guarantee you tomorrow we’re going to have like 1,000 more. The numbers are going to go up.” “That’s no problem at all. Thank you very much. That’s very nice. Thank you. Sounds good. See you then. Bye. Well, I have been working. A lot of people are not, which is hard. This place used to have 30 employees, and on Sunday we let go of 90% of the staff. We want to reopen so we can rehire people, you know? It was really hard to let everyone go. These are people that are at the level, they’re not wealthy, you know? This is a very harsh reality. And actually what the job is, is smiling through stress. And this is hard to smile through.” [Rain falling] “It’s go time here at the community kitchen. This is the time where we have to ramp up our services to be very sensitive to how people are feeling. People are coming to us feeling vulnerable. They maybe work in the restaurant industry. People who work in Broadway and in a lot of the behind-the-scenes, they’re coming here saying, well, I don’t have work. So those industries are the folks that are the first ones that we’re seeing come through. But we’re preparing to see more people come through in need.” “All programming at the senior center is suspended for the next two weeks. Stay safe and have a good day.” “So this is not business as usual. We don’t know what’s coming up if people have to stay in their homes for a longer period of time. And we want to make sure people are getting food, especially since a lot of industries are out of work. We are expecting a lot of new people, and we are going to be ready to receive them. This is all very new for them, and some of them are feeling guilt or shame coming to an emergency food program. So we have to remember that we do this all the time, but for them, it’s something new and something that they feel anxious about doing. We’re just getting them registered. They’re getting food. That’s our main priority is people are getting food.” [Sighing with exasperation] “I’m not supposed to touch my face. Hold on a second.” “I have prepared myself already, mentally, multiple times, to go back to Oregon and leave this entire beautiful dream behind me. So many people, including many of my friends, are working at bars, at restaurants, which are now closed. And now we’re all at home, wondering, Can we make it another month? Can our families afford to pay their mortgages at home? Do we just need to go back and start working, just so we can help our own families, the people that we love the most, stay in the homes that we grew up in? It’s hard to think that my mom or my dad are never going to see retirement. The best things that we can do right now as a community is just to give ourselves over to something that brings us true happiness. Because right now, it feels like it’s about to get very desperate.” “This is only something that we can get through if we’re working together. There will be so much suffering, unnecessary suffering, if we’re not really looking out for each other and if we only think about ourselves and our well-being. We have to be thinking about each other.” [Birds chirping]",

An 80-year-old passenger had tested positive for the new coronavirus after getting off the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Hong Kong.\n\n“Would kindly inform the ship related parties and do the necessary disinfection,” Princess’s port representative wrote on Feb. 1, relaying a warning from Hong Kong health officials. “Many thanks!”\n\nNothing happened. Princess says it believes the alert sat unread in unmonitored inboxes. Grant Tarling, the company’s top doctor and the person in charge of responding to outbreaks, said he hadn’t learned about the infection until the following day — after being alerted to a post on social media.\n\nThe fumbled alert was just the beginning of a broader breakdown by both the company and the Japanese authorities who quarantined the ship in Yokohama. Hobbled by confusion and mistakes, they played down the risk of infection, ignored best medical practice for evacuating passengers, and activated only low-level protocols for dealing with outbreaks. Ultimately, eight people died and more than 700 were infected, including some government officials.",

    "article_text": "The Trump administration on Friday cut off tens of millions of dollars for health care programs and other aid in Yemen, rejecting pleas by humanitarian groups and some members of Congress to delay the decision as the coronavirus spreads across the Middle East.\n\nAmerican officials said the move was a necessary response to longstanding interference by Houthi rebels who control the northern part of Yemen. They have been fighting a civil war for the past five years and have imposed harsh restrictions on organizations trying to deliver aid. The fighting has killed thousands of civilians, and millions more face starvation in what the United Nations has labeled the world’s worst humanitarian crisis.\n\nBut as a pandemic looms, the American decision created major funding gaps for dozens of programs run by the United Nations and private aid groups, including efforts to supply the Yemenis with hand soap and medicine and to staff clinics with health care workers, humanitarian officials said.\n\nCiting conditions that have already made Yemen a breeding ground for disease, the officials said they feared that populations weakened by hunger and packed into refugee camps would be further decimated by the coronavirus.",

    "article_text": "As coronavirus continues to spread across the globe, we’re working to answer the questions on many parents’ minds. This is a fast moving situation, so some information may be outdated. For the latest updates, read the New York Times’s live coronavirus coverage here.\n\nInfections and deaths from the new coronavirus continue to spread worldwide, and the World Health Organization has officially declared the outbreak a pandemic.\n\nMany people are starting to talk about social distancing as a strategy to combat the virus, which means limiting activities outside the home to obtaining health care, acquiring food and essential supplies and going to work, if working from home isn’t an option. This approach most likely sounds novel to many, and possibly even draconian to some, but it is very familiar to me.\n\nAnd it works.\n\nI should know. I am a physician who practiced social distancing for 18 months to protect my premature babies.\n\nThe concept is simple: Those practicing social distancing should stay home as much as possible and look to keep a gap of six feet or more between themselves and others if they do leave the house. The reasoning: Fewer interactions with people and the added distance when you must interact means less chance of exposure and hence infection with the virus. If you do get infected, social distancing lowers your chance of spreading the infection to someone else.",

    "article_text": "Those extreme measures still will not end the epidemic completely. But the United States cannot long endure in a state of suspended animation, nor can the nation easily bear the cost of repeated lockdowns. That’s why it is also critical to fund and implement the safety measures necessary to let Americans get back to work, school and play without a recrudescence of the virus.\n\nIn fact, a nationwide lockdown should be seen as only the first step in a long fight that will proceed at a different pace in different parts of the country. In New York, where doctors and nurses dressed in trash bags and bandannas are desperately fighting to contain the virus even as bodies pile up, the crisis is upon us. In three weeks, when case counts in New York may be peaking, outbreaks in other parts of the country might just be entering a phase of deadly exponential growth. The virus may complicate matters even further by receding in late spring or summer, only to re-emerge in the fall or winter.\n\nWe need to prepare for what’s ahead.\n\nTest, Test, Test\n\nThe virus will almost certainly re-emerge as individual states and cities start to lift the strictures of social distancing and shelter-in-place — but, ideally, that re-emergence will look more like a string of smaller brush fires than one raging forest fire. Health officials will not be able to detect those brush fires, or keep them from growing, without diagnostic tests. They will need enough tests both to survey the population at random and to diagnose patients who experience symptoms. They will also need the capacity to isolate those who test positive, and to identify, quarantine and monitor their contacts. If those contacts develop symptoms, they’ll need to be able to test them, too.\n\nTo build such capacity, the federal government will have to invest in the nation’s undervalued and deeply strained public health system: more funding will be crucial, but it will not be enough. State and federal leaders should work together, now, to create a public works corps to assist epidemiologists with contact tracing, to erect thousands of drive-through testing sites, and to do the work of infection control in nursing homes and homeless shelters. Some states are already doing this on their own, but others will need federal funding — perhaps in the form of block grants.\n\nAntibody tests, which can determine whether someone has been exposed to the virus and may therefore be immune, will help get people back to work safely, allowing individuals and public health authorities to gauge who can proceed without worry, and who needs to take additional precautions. Scientists, in America and elsewhere, have already developed such tests. The federal government should orchestrate production of the tests in the necessary numbers.",

And I love playing violin. OK, I’m going to have to stand up for this. A lot of things are really happening right now, like Covid-19. [Violin playing] I’ve heard that it is a very contagious virus. And when people get it, a lot of people have to go to the hospital. But some of them have to get isolated. It’s changed my life because now, we don’t get to go in school. My teacher told us that she didn’t know if it was going to close for the whole year. Ta-da.” “You’ve got blanky fuzz in your hair. Right now, me and Allia are actually living in a family shelter.” “I don’t like the way you brush it. You brush it so hard. Basically, it’s one room with a bathroom, and then one bed and a bunk bed. I guess, it’s now my classroom, too.” “I got contacted by her school to go pick up her iPad device. And her iPad does not have internet. The shelter that we’re in, they do not allow internet. What classroom stuff are we going to do today? Math?” “Well, science is already too hard. It keeps on pausing itself, just freezing.” “Oh OK, I will look into that in a little bit.” “Across the room.” “And see what’s going on. I have a cellphone. We use the hot spot. I don’t have a lot of data. And it’s a little spotty and slow. Essentially, that’s just where we’ve been is puttering outside to get a better signal, hoping it gets better.” “A school has 17 tables in the cafeteria. Each table has 12 seats.” “I am worried that children are going to get left behind because they don’t have their devices or they didn’t have the access to the internet. Let’s try that one again.” “So we’ll probably have to redo our whole grade, and relearn everything we already know.” “Right now, my biggest worry for Allia would be the social interaction. My mother, who’s disabled, and her service animal lives with us. So we’re all in this really tiny space.” “Yeah. I’m worried about that because my grandmother, she is really old. And if she gets it or if my mother gets sick, they could get hurt. And if they both get it, who’s going to take care of me that day? And then if we’re all locked in the same room, how are we going to be safe?”",

    "article_text": "dr. fabiano di marco\n\nCan you see me? No, I think.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI cannot see you, but I can hear you. And I think I can hear you — ah, now I can see you.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nOK. Sorry for my English. I don’t know if my English will be adequate for a podcast. But then you will decide, OK?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt’s exceptional. And I’m really grateful that you’re making time for us.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo, where are you right now?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nNow, I’m at home. After three weeks, today, in the afternoon, I am at home, because I have a big family with three children. And I decide to come back at home one day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you have not been home in three weeks?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThree weeks, yes. I have been in my hospital every day, start of the crisis, Friday the 21st of February. And since then, it was a total mess. It’s like a war, to be honest.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nFrom the New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”\n\n[music]\n\narchived recording This is how Italy’s cases have grown now for the last month — slowly at first, but now more rapidly. It’s a textbook epidemic curve.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nItaly has quickly become the new epicenter of the pandemic, with nearly 30,000 infections and more than 2,000 deaths, numbers that are soaring by the day, even after the government there took extreme measures to lock down much of the country.\n\narchived recording (dr. jerome adams) We are at a critical inflection point in this country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday, the U.S. surgeon general warned that the United States is now on a strikingly similar path.\n\narchived recording (dr. jerome adams) People, we are where Italy was two weeks ago in terms of our numbers. And we have a choice to make as a nation. Do we want to go the direction of South Korea and really be aggressive and lower our mortality rates? Or do we want to go the direction of Italy?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nToday, a conversation with a doctor in Bergamo, north of Milan, one of Italy’s hardest hit areas.\n\n[music]\n\nIt’s Tuesday, March 17.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCould I just ask you to just say your full name for me?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nOK. My name is Fabiano Di Marco. I’m a professor of the University of Milan and the head of the respiratory unit of the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII of Bergamo, which is a town close to Milan.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nCan you give me a sense, and maybe paint the picture, of what it’s like in the hospital right now, what you’re dealing with?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI have now — my ward has been totally transformed. Nothing is as before. I’ve been in my hospital every single day for 14 hours or 15 hours a day —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\n— to try to deal with the outbreak of coronavirus infection.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat has been the story of what has happened in your hospital these past few weeks? Because I think people in the United States are desperate to understand what you have seen, and what people have said to you, and what it has looked like. You described it as a war. So we want to understand what you mean.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nOK. Every day we receive, on average, between 50 to 70 patients with severe respiratory failure due to coronavirus infection. Every single day. And to describe my reality, my hospital is, at least in Europe, a huge hospital with 1,000 beds. But to receive every day between 50 and 70 patients with severe pneumonia due to coronavirus, it’s impossible. You have to change your organization day by day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd tell me what you mean. How do you have to change your organization to deal with people who are in such severe respiratory condition?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nSo we change it, the normal ward, mainly surgery wards, because the activity of surgery has been reduced off at least 80 percent. And we transform it, so far five wards of surgery for patients with coronavirus. Now we have, between the five wards and the emergency room, at least 350 patients with respiratory failure due to coronavirus infection.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nToday is the first day in which we have more than 50 percent of the hospital dedicated to coronavirus patients. To organize these, we had to teach cardiologists, dermatologists, rheumatologists — specialists of something very different from respiratory failure — how to treat this patient. You try to find a solution. But day by day, it’s no longer enough. So I can tell you that my colleagues, both physicians and nurses, they cry every day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI’m 47. I’m not so, so old to be the head of a ward, at least in Italy. But I have with me 20 colleagues who are respiratory physician, with many fellow. They are 27, 30. So for me, it’s a huge responsibility. And I was scared they can be sick. OK? But we cry every day. And now, we have today, 460 nurse at home because they are sick. And I think we have —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYes. It’s a very huge number.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou have 460 nurses who are in a hospital in the middle of this crisis who are home because they’re sick?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah, today. This is the outcome of today.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd is that because they are sick with the coronavirus?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThere are some who are sick, some with a total burnout for the situation, and other who are contact of patients, so they stay in quarantine at home.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDoctor, you said you are upset, that you maybe even cry every day. And I wonder if there is an experience, maybe one story or one patient, that made you upset?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThe main problem for us is to treat our colleagues. As doctor, we are used to treat patients. And for us it’s normal. There is not so emotional, luckily, because we are used to treat other people. But this is difficult when the patient is your colleague. And we have now admitted tens of colleagues or nurse, people who you will meet every day in your life.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYour colleagues are now your patients because they have contracted the virus.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. For example, yesterday, the chief of my department come to the emergency room to be with a low level of oxygenation. He has a bilateral pneumonia due to coronavirus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow. I’m sorry.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nNot very severe. But he was someone who tried to organize the hospital to deal with this infection three days ago. And we went to have a dinner with my wife and his wife one week ago.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI don’t know. We are scared because on Friday, only in my hospital, we had 20 deaths.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\n20 deaths.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. For coronavirus. In one day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat’s extraordinary.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. So another important thing, we have not had the opportunity to allow the relative to come to the hospital for two reasons. First, it’s a danger for them and for other people, evidently, because in 80 percent of the cases, they are infected. The second reason, which is not easy to understand if you are not in this situation, is that we do not have enough personal protective equipment — the mask in case of infection, something to cover the shoes, and the gown. It’s impossible to find these now Europe, not only in Italy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you’re running out of those and you can’t get them anywhere, in the region or anywhere in Europe. You just can’t get them.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. Impossible to find.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nIf I allow one or two relative to come to the hospital, I have to give them these. But we do not have this for us.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. You need them for doctors.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. They cannot receive the relative in hospital. So the patients are alone. And they die alone. We — this is difficult for us. We try to call, every day, the relative. But I have to tell you that sometimes, in the confusion of this new organization with a dermatologist who is trying to treat a patient with severe respiratory failure, and probably the doctors cry, and the — no one remember to call the relative. So it’s happened that the relative call the hospital —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd the person’s already dead.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back. Doctor, you’ve mentioned a lot of the choices that you and your staff have to make now that this is such a terrible situation. And I wonder how you make decisions about who gets which treatment, and who has the best chance to survive. How do you make those decisions?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThis is, for us, a crucial point, because we have hundreds of very sick patients. But we have tens of I.C.U. beds.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThe problem is that you can find many scores of gravity. But these scores of gravity have been thought for another reason. OK?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd when you say score of gravity, you mean, basically, kind of a calculation of who is in greatest need?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. So for instance, if you are 80, you have a severe respiratory failure, and I don’t know, you have also renal failure, I have to admit you in the I.C.U. because you are very severe. And you have a probability to die very high. OK. I have to admit you in the I.C.U.. But now we need another score, which is a score which help us to understand your probability to benefit of the I.C.U. bed. And we do not have this score. OK?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBecause it has not been created.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. We are trying to do this now, because for example, the age, for all of the stage of severity, higher is the age, higher is the score. But when you have few beds for many people, the age is absolutely the opposite. If you are 85, I give the bed to another one who is 45.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBecause 45-year-old is more likely to benefit from the I.C.U. bed than the 80-year-old. So you’re saying all the normal rules have to be thrown out the window.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. We need a new tool we do not have, because so far, the difference between the number of patients, number or bed, is something totally new for us. OK? And not only for us, all the country will have to deal with this. But it’s difficult to tell people that if you are 80, you will never have the I.C.U. bed.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOf course.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nBut so far, if you have not the opportunity to build a new hospital with 1,000 bed, such as in China, we need this terrible tool, because this is a tool of selection.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight — of who lives and who dies.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. And this is why it’s important. If you do not reduce the number of patients who are sick, it’s impossible to deal with this disease. Impossible. You have to reduce the rate of infection. And the only way to reduce the rate of infection is to change totally the life of people. Now, in Italy, everyone is at home. This is a tragedy for economy. No one is working. No one is working. But it’s the only way. There is not something in between.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like you’re saying that once you are in a hospital as a doctor, looking at a room full of people with this virus, overwhelmed, it’s too late. That the role of countries who are not yet at the place Italy is in is to make sure they don’t ever get to that place, don’t ever get to the point that your hospital is at. And to do whatever it takes to not get there.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nAbsolutely. You have two choices. You decide to not close all the activities, close the people in their home, and you will accept thousand of beds. Or, you have to close all the activity. There is not a choice in between. I know this is difficult to have this approach, because also in Italy, if you speak with my colleague in another town, it’s quite difficult to understand this. Because many people, including many physicians, have not this perception of this. Because in your reality, all is normal. It’s difficult to be scared for something you have not the perception. OK? So I can understand that in other countries, it’s the same. But trust us, or, such as in Bergamo, each family will have a relative or a friend who dies. This is the situation in Bergamo. This is not a disease that you can discuss on TV, or you will have the perception of this in your family, in your relative, in your town. It’s something very aggressive, very aggressive.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder, as a doctor, what advice you would give to doctors in the United States who may have to do what you have to do and make the kind of difficult decisions that you have to make now.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nI think that the best is to speak with us to analyze the situation of Italy. It could be something important. Because you have to be prepared for this. This is the only thing I would suggest to my colleague. Because also in Italy, I have some colleague in the other part of Italy who are not prepared. And I speak with them. They are doing the same thing we did three weeks ago. This is incredible. This new reality we are living started the 23rd of February, not three years ago. OK? Three weeks ago. After three weeks, we are living in another dimension. For me, it’s difficult to think to my life before this. No one can be prepared for this — impossible.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder, just a final question here. At the beginning of our conversation, you said you were finally home after three weeks. And I wonder what it was like to come home to your family. What are you telling them? And how are you feeling?\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nMy children are at home now for three weeks. The schools are closed. Luckily there are three, so they can stay together. But we try to create a normal situation at home. For me, it’s difficult, because evidently, I have a risk of infection which is higher than compared to other people. So I had to decide what to do at home. If stay with a mask — sorry. And I decide to stay normal, without the mask.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like this was a tough decision.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah, because I have to find the solution between to protect the best, uh, my wife and do not scare my children. OK? The only good news is that children and young boys or girls are not affected. This is the only consolation for us. And I decide that I changed my approach to my children. OK? I pay attention to my hands. I pay attention to my towel. OK? But I decide to not wear a mask because it will be difficult for them to see the father who is a respiratory physician in Bergamo with those kind of cases, hundreds of that. So also for these, it’s really difficult to decide what is the best. And then I spoke with my wife. And we decided to do this.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt sounds like on top of all the difficult decisions you’ve had to make, you had to go home and make one more difficult decision, which was this mask.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nYeah. Absolutely.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDoctor, I really want to thank you so much for giving us your time. And I want to wish you the best of luck, you and all your colleagues, doctors and nurses at the hospital. We’re going to be thinking about you a lot in the coming days.\n\ndr. fabiano di marco\n\nThank you. Thank you. It has been a privilege. I hope, indeed, to be useful for some of my colleagues and for you.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) This afternoon, we’re announcing new guidelines for every American to follow over the next 15 days. As we combat the virus, each and every one of us has a critical role to play in stopping —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Monday, President Trump issued sweeping new health guidelines for Americans, encouraging them to work from home, avoid restaurants, bars, and food courts, and discretionary travel, and limit gatherings to 10 people or fewer.\n\narchived recording (donald trump) If everyone makes this change or these critical changes and sacrifices now, we will rally together as one nation. And we will defeat the virus. And we’re going to have a big celebration all together.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut the guidelines are not mandatory. And the president stopped short of explicitly ordering Americans to stay home, as several countries in Europe and a handful of U.S. counties are now doing. On Monday, health officials in the Bay Area of California instructed nearly 7 million people to remain in their homes, with few exceptions, to slow the virus’s spread.\n\narchived recording These new orders direct all individuals to shelter at their place of residence and maintain social distancing of at least 6 feet from any other person when outside their residence. We know we need to do this. And we know we need a regional approach.\n\nmichael barbaro",

    "article_text": "How hopeful you feel about the direction this response is taking may depend on how long ago you refreshed your news feed. Just last week (which feels like a hundred years ago), a friend suggested that there may be a sort of Freudian transference from coronavirus to climate — that the fear and sense of urgency will be lifted from the faster-moving crisis and settle on the slower one, becoming a catalyst for much-needed action. So far, it seems any transference is working in the opposite direction: Lockdowns and social distancing are providing a litany of necessary actions ripe for the transferal of nebulous climate anxieties and fears. In this context, consumerism perversely provides some relief — you can finally go buy dry goods to prepare for the apocalypse.\n\nBut personal consumption and travel habits are, in fact, changing, which has some people wondering if this might be the beginning of a meaningful shift. Maybe, as you hunker down with cabinets full of essentials, your sense of what consumer goods you need will shrink. Maybe, even after the acute phase of the coronavirus crisis has passed, you will be more likely to telecommute. Lifestyles that include, for example, frequent long-distance travel already seem ethically questionable in light of the climate crisis, and, in an age irrevocably scarred by pandemic, these lifestyles may come to be seen as grossly irresponsible. Maybe among the relatively wealthy, jumping on a plane for a weekend away or for a destination wedding will come to seem unthinkable.\n\nSweeping changes in individual habits — particularly in wealthy countries with high per capita consumption — could lead to lower emissions, which would be an unequivocal good. But personal habits may matter less because of direct reductions in carbon emissions and more because of “behavioral contagion,” a term from the social sciences that refers to the way ideas and behaviors spread through a population and can, in terms of climate action, lead to changes in voting and even policy.\n\nWhich is to say, in order to be meaningful for global emissions, changes in consumption habits as a result of the virus would need to extend beyond individuals to the larger structures that shape our lives. In China, it wasn’t telecommuting or grounded planes that led to the 25 percent drop in emissions. It was the abrupt halt of industrial manufacturing. (The concept of the “personal carbon footprint” was popularized by BP in a 2005 media campaign costing over $100 million — a campaign that, research has indicated, deflected responsibility for climate change away from the corporation and onto the individual consumer.) This is not to say that personal consumption is meaningless — a significant reduction in air travel could decrease aviation emissions. But aviation accounts for only about 2.5 percent of global emissions, an amount that looks downright puny in the shadow cast by heavy industry.\n\nIf anything, the short-term positive effects on the climate that we’re seeing today serve as a dramatic reminder that changing personal consumption habits will mean very little going forward if we also fail to decarbonize the global economy.",

The Montgomerys thought they qualified because they share a cabin without windows or a balcony and Mr. Montgomery, 68, has diabetes.\n\nTheir hopes were quickly dashed. The health minister’s statement, it turned out, had been ambiguous. The captain of the vessel, the Diamond Princess, announced narrower criteria for offshore quarantine: passengers 80 or older with underlying medical conditions or windowless cabins.\n\n“Looks like we’re not going anywhere,” said Ms. Montgomery, 67.\n\nThe misunderstanding punctuated what critics call Japan’s bungled communications during the crisis, reinforcing how the nation has been vexed by an epidemiological challenge that grows each day. With more and more of the Diamond Princess 3,400 anxious passengers and crew getting sick — possibly infecting one another — health officials have even raised the possibility of prolonging the quarantine, now set to expire next Wednesday.",

And with that mutual support, I’m hopeful that most of us will be able to resist any urge to re-engage in our behavior.”\n\nBut Kristen Marshall, who manages the DOPE Project in San Francisco for the national Harm Reduction Coalition, is not nearly as hopeful. To help prevent overdoses, the project distributes clean syringes, addiction medications like naloxone and Narcan, snacks and water bottles to programs working directly with people without housing. She is considered an essential worker who does not have to heed the state’s orders to shelter in place, so she is moving about the city with other health workers, to aid people without housing who are suffering from addictions and health crises, ordered to scatter, their belongings confiscated.\n\n“Closing or limiting programs designed to support them puts them at even higher risk for overdose and overdose death,” Ms. Marshall said.\n\nShe added: “For so many of our folks, their contact with our programs are some of their only opportunities for socialization and connection. So workers and their organizations are desperately trying to balance keeping themselves healthy and safe while also refusing to close their programs’ doors.”\n\nThe business shutdown orders rolling through the country are hitting some in the recovery community in ironic ways. On the Facebook group Harm Reduction Abstinence Moderation Support, which accepts many people who handle substance issues by reducing use instead of abstaining, some worry that with some liquor stores closing, they will have to withdraw cold turkey and plunge into delirium tremens — or the “DTs,” with hallucinations, vomiting, fever and high blood pressure. And then they fear they won’t be admitted into overcrowded emergency departments. Or will be exposed to Covid-19 in those waiting rooms.",

Dramatic declines in street traffic show that people are staying home. Hospitals have so far not been overwhelmed. And preliminary statistical models provided to public officials in Washington State suggest that the spread of the virus has slowed in the Seattle area in recent days.\n\nWhile each infected person was spreading the virus to an average of 2.7 other people earlier in March, that number appears to have dropped, with one projection suggesting that it was now down to 1.4.\n\nThe researchers who are preparing the latest projections, led by the Institute for Disease Modeling, a private research group in Bellevue, Wash., have been watching a variety of data points since the onset of the outbreak.

The Group of 7 industrialized nations is expected to hold an emergency call on Tuesday to synchronize a multinational effort to stimulate economic growth, the first such effort since the global financial crisis more than a decade ago.\n\nThe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund signaled they were also ready to provide assistance, particularly to poor nations.

    "article_text": "Last week, many people were astonished to hear that Dr. Kurt Kloss, an emergency room physician in New York, reached out to a Facebook group for some 20,000 of his colleagues seeking advice about how to handle the coronavirus outbreak. “If you were in charge of Federal response to the Pandemic,” his post began, “what would your recommendation be?”\n\nThe question wasn’t just hypothetical. Dr. Kloss’s daughter is married to the brother of Jared Kushner, who had been put in charge of the White House response to the pandemic. But many people commented in alarm: Crowdsourcing medical advice on social media, is that a reliable way to get life-or-death health information?\n\nAs an emergency room doctor at the front lines of the pandemic, however, I wasn’t surprised. I’ve been working back-to-back shifts at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, where the state’s first patient hospitalized with Covid-19 is being treated, and have had several patients test positive for the novel coronavirus. And like many of my colleagues, I have been gathering information from Facebook, Twitter and other social media outlets.\n\nOne private Facebook group I’m a member of, created by Dr. Kabir Rezvankhoo, an E.R. and intensive-care-unit doctor in Texas whom I used to work with, is reserved for doctors who have or are likely to care for critically ill patients with Covid-19. The group quickly grew to nearly 15,000 members. When I asked Dr. Rezvankhoo why he initiated the group, his reply was simple: “Because information on the new coronavirus is difficult to come across.”",

The tension comes against the backdrop of sickness and death for health care professionals, in China, Italy and Spain, and now more than 200 health care workers sick in New York.\n\nMostly, staff and administrators are fighting over masks, whether they should be worn outside of treatment rooms, and which kind of masks — thinner surgical ones, or heavier respiratory masks. Should they be worn at all times? Only in procedures or while visiting patients? There is also some quibbling over testing and isolation: whom to test and when, and whom to isolate, given limited bed space? Whom to send home if a staff member has symptoms, and whom to require to work?\n\nSome hospitals allow masks outside of treatment rooms and some even make them mandatory. But a number of others say they aren’t necessary at all times and don’t allow them. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidance has changed several times. Currently, it says medical professionals don’t need to wear masks all the time. It also says that if there’s not enough protective equipment available, homemade solutions like bandannas or scarfs are OK for health care workers to wear.\n\nOn Tuesday Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, a leading member of the federal government’s coronavirus response task force, told CNN that the C.D.C. was considering another change: it is reviewing its guidelines on whether the general public should wear masks.\n\nAmid the confusion, furious and terrified, doctors and nurses say they must trust their own judgment. Administrators counter that doctors and nurses, motivated by fear, are writing their own rules.",

    "article_text": "Although it’s impossible to say how many Americans will die because of the new coronavirus, under a reasonable set of assumptions the number of fatalities could be high — potentially in the hundreds of thousands or more.\n\nDeaths on that scale are not easy to grasp. To put the estimates in context, we’re comparing the possible toll with other leading causes of death in the United States in 2018, the most recent year with data available. We’ve started with an estimate from a University of Nebraska public health researcher, Dr. James Lawler, that was recently presented to hospital executives: 480,000 American deaths over the course of the illness known as Covid-19.\n\nUse the sliders below to see how the possible death toll of the coronavirus compares.\n\nInfection rate Pct. contracting virus Fatality rate Share of those infected who die\n\nHere is where coronavirus deaths would rank in the U.S., assuming an overall infection rate of _ and fatality rate of _ over the next year:\n\nHow Coronavirus Deaths Could Compare With Other Major Killers Cause of death U.S. Deaths Figures are one-year estimates. It’s possible coronavirus deaths will span multiple years. · Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nAll of the estimates depend on two basic questions: How many Americans will be infected with the virus? And how many who are infected will end up dying? Our sliders allow you to consider a range of options.\n\nAs The New York Times reported last week, epidemiologists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently prepared four scenarios. Their calculations showed a large range of possible fatalities in the United States: between 200,000 and 1.7 million Americans over the course of Covid-19, assuming minimal efforts to contain it.\n\n[See which places are most at risk of running out of hospital beds in different outbreak scenarios.]\n\nFew things kill anywhere near so many people in this country. These comparisons assume that the entire coronavirus pandemic runs its course in one year, though it could well take longer.\n\nDr. Lawler’s estimate, 480,000 deaths, is higher than the number who die in a year from dementia, emphysema, stroke or diabetes. There are only two causes of death that kill more Americans: cancer, which kills just under 600,000 in a year, and heart disease, which kills around 650,000.\n\nA coronavirus death toll near the top of the C.D.C. range (1.7 million) would mean more deaths from the disease than the number of Americans typically killed by cancer and heart disease put together.\n\nMarc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health, places a 20 percent infection share at the low end of what is likely. The governments in Britain and Germany are proceeding on the assumption that the virus may infect 60 percent to 70 percent of their populations.\n\nMany scientists and public health officials who have studied the data so far say they expect a fatality rate for Covid-19 of around 1 percent. But the documented fatality rate in most places is still higher. Places where a flood of sick patients have overwhelmed hospital capacity have had higher death rates than places where everyone who needs medical care can get it.\n\nIt’s possible fewer people will die here, either because conditions are substantially different in the United States, or because better treatments are developed, or because efforts to slow the spread help protect the people who are most vulnerable to severe disease. Evidence from South Korea, where the government has undertaken widespread screening and infection control measures, shows a fatality rate closer to 0.8 percent. In Hubei, China, where the disease began, far less than 20 percent of the population has been infected. But China has also imposed strict containment measures, and some experts worry that the numbers could rise once those rules are lifted.\n\n“Anyone who says they know where this is going doesn’t know enough about the virus: We just don’t know,” said Tom Frieden, who was director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the Obama administration and now runs the nonprofit group Resolve to Save Lives. “What’s going to happen in China when they reopen the economy? We don’t know.”\n\nDr. Frieden has published his own estimates for the potential death toll. The top of his range assumes no more than half the U.S. population becomes infected. He puts the fatality rate at 1 percent, resulting in about 1.6 million deaths, though he noted that public health efforts could reduce that number.\n\nHow Different Age Groups Could Be Affected\n\nThe evidence from China, Italy and other countries that have experienced outbreaks suggests that the deaths will cluster among the oldest Americans. In Italy, for example, the average age at death from the disease stood at 81 earlier this month, according to the country’s health department.\n\nThe tables below describe the possible effects of coronavirus on Americans of different ages, assuming that fatality rates by age are distributed in the same proportions as those observed in Hubei. The tables also assume that coronavirus cases will be distributed in the same proportions as have been observed so far in the United States according to data collected by The Times. These rankings should be seen as approximate because scientists are still studying the effects of age on the severity of the disease.\n\nHere is where coronavirus deaths would rank among different age groups, assuming an overall infection rate of _ and fatality rate of _ over the next year:\n\nAge 10 to 19 Age 20 to 29 Age 30 to 39 Age 40 to 49 Age 50 to 59 Age 60 to 69 Age 70 to 79 Age 80+ Figures are one-year estimates. Coronavirus deaths could span multiple years. Because no young children in China were reported to have died from the coronavirus, our estimates assume no deaths among Americans younger than 10. · Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\n\nThe overall death toll is expected to be concentrated among older patients. But older people have a higher risk of dying of other leading causes of death, too. Younger people, of course, are far less likely to die of things like heart disease and cancer. That means that, while coronavirus deaths under more grim scenarios could become a top cause of death among older Americans, it could also rank among the top causes of death for younger people. Suppose there are 480,000 deaths from Covid-19. That could make coronavirus the second most common cause of death among Americans in their 70s, and the fifth most common cause of death among Americans in their 20s, if the current patterns in infections and deaths continue to hold.\n\nThese age-specific estimates are only rough guides. The most detailed estimates of coronavirus fatality rates by age come from China, and public health researchers say they are the best working assumptions. But these numbers are imperfect. Smoking rates among Chinese men are substantially higher than those in the United States, which may mean that older Chinese patients have more cumulative lung damage than older people in the United States.\n\nIt is also somewhat unclear whether older people are more likely to be infected with coronavirus — it appears so from the Chinese data — or whether they are just more likely to have been tested and counted. Our calculations used data about the age distribution of infections that have been reported in the United States. Those estimates aren’t perfect, so the number of deaths could be somewhat higher or lower among young Americans.\n\nAs the virus spreads in the United States, and as testing capacity improves, we will have a better sense of how many lives will be lost.",

    "article_text": "michael barbaro\n\nFrom The New York Times, I’m Michael Barbaro. This is “The Daily.”\n\n[music]\n\nToday: China says it has made lifesaving reforms since the last time it was the source of a public health crisis 17 years ago. So why is the deadly coronavirus spreading so rapidly across the country? My colleague, Javier Hernández, reports from the center of the outbreak. It’s Thursday, January 30. Javier, how did you first hear about this outbreak?\n\njavier hernández\n\nWell, we started hearing reports in early January that there was this mysterious virus that was affecting Wuhan, which is a city in central China.\n\narchived recording Staff at Wuhan Hospital are working around the clock to identify a mystery virus.\n\njavier hernández\n\nPeople were falling ill to this kind of pneumonia-like virus, which scientists were calling a coronavirus.\n\narchived recording Experts believe this is a new kind of coronavirus, which typically causes symptoms of the common cold, but in some rare cases, can lead to pneumonia.\n\njavier hernández\n\nIt’s a very frightening virus that spreads from animals to humans. It was believed to be behind some very serious respiratory illnesses, so it sounded pretty scary. But the official narrative was that this strain couldn’t pass from human to human. It would only go from animals to humans.\n\narchived recording The potentially deadly coronavirus is thought to have spread from animals into humans at a live produce market in Wuhan.\n\njavier hernández\n\nAnd at that point, they were saying that it was all originating at a single meat market in central China. This meat market sold wild animals, things like bamboo rats, badgers, wolves even. And the assumption was that people had come into contact with these animals and picked up this virus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd it sounds like because it was one meat market, and because this virus could only pass from animals to humans, that this is a pretty small problem.\n\njavier hernández\n\nAt this point, the reports were that only about 130 people had been infected and that, of those, only about four had died.\n\narchived recording Chinese officials say the outbreak is under control.\n\njavier hernández\n\nAnd so the prognosis was that the outbreak was controllable, that it was treatable and that things would be O.K.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Javier, what are you thinking when you hear the Chinese government talking this way, saying that everything is going to be O.K.?\n\njavier hernández\n\nWe were a bit skeptical. We knew that the Chinese government had a history of downplaying outbreaks like this. And as we saw more and more reports in the international media of this virus spreading, we began to question whether the officials were being totally upfront about what was happening.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what do you mean when you say a history of downplaying situations like this?\n\njavier hernández\n\nWell before this virus, there was the outbreak of SARS 17 years ago. And it turned into this global health crisis that infected more than 8,000 people. It killed more than 800 people. And a big part of the reason that it spread so violently was because the Chinese government didn’t tell the world. And there was this period of months and months when it was spreading very rapidly in China, and the world just didn’t know about it. And for a lot of Chinese today, that experience with SARS makes them very skeptical of anything that the government says when it comes to public health.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd I imagine a reporter like you would be similarly skeptical.\n\njavier hernández\n\nRight. We really wanted to make sure that we got this one right. We wanted to double check that this was, in fact, a small scale outbreak as the government was portraying it. And we wanted to talk to people who were getting sick with this virus to get a sense of what it was like for them — how severe it was, whether they were getting the care they needed.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd so what do you do?\n\njavier hernández\n\nSo I live in Beijing. So I rushed to our bureau here and grabbed masks, enough to last me a couple days, and then headed to the airport and boarded a flight to Wuhan. And I just remember everyone on board, almost everyone, was wearing a mask. I was just struck by that. You never see people wear masks on this scale. And so it felt like there was this sense of anxiety already in the air even before we landed.\n\n[music]\n\nOnce I got there, I rushed off to meet an ambulance doctor who had been posting on social media about this outbreak. And we had contacted him because he was challenging the official narrative about what was happening. He was saying he didn’t believe the official numbers. He thought that this could be another SARS-like outbreak.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what was happening to his posts once they went online?\n\njavier hernández\n\nThey lasted for a while, and then they would be taken down, just disappeared. It was clear that the government was cleaning and trying to scrub the internet of any critical questions about official data. And so we wanted to talk to him about what he was seeing on the ground.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what did he tell you?\n\njavier hernández\n\nHe told me that he felt like people weren’t taking enough precautions, that the government wasn’t being urgent enough. And he worked in a hospital and had a lot of interaction with doctors and other medical workers. So he felt like his job could be at stake if he were to come forward publicly.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo the numbers the Chinese government is providing are relatively small. This ambulance doctor you’re meeting with is saying the problem is bigger. So what do you do to try to reconcile those two pieces of information?\n\njavier hernández\n\nWe wanted to find the people whose relatives had fallen ill to this virus. And so we were looking online for people who were reporting symptoms of fever, cough, basically anything that was associated with this kind of virus. And we stumbled on a guy from Shanghai. He was a 40-year-old architect, and he told me that his stepmother had died just a couple of days earlier from a mysterious pneumonia-like illness. And so I found him, sent him a message, and we agreed to meet at a cafe. [CHATTER]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what is the story of what happened to his stepmom?\n\njavier hernández\n\nHe tells me that she was a very healthy, normal 65-year-old woman who, a couple of weeks earlier, had started to feel like she was having a flu. So she had some coughing. She had kind of a sore throat, but it didn’t seem like anything that bad. But it suddenly began to worsen. She was having a fever. She needed a respirator to breathe. And all very suddenly she was sent to a contagious disease ward, and the family was told that she would likely die.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what did she or her stepson understand about what was behind her illness?\n\njavier hernández\n\nThey didn’t really understand much. For days and days, according to Mr. Wei, the family had tried to get her tested for this coronavirus, this mysterious virus that was spreading across Wuhan. And the doctors and other medical workers refused. He pulled out his phone and showed me her death certificate, and all it said was that she died of severe pneumonia.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut why wouldn’t they test her, and what does it tell you that they wouldn’t test her?\n\njavier hernández\n\nIt became clear to me in that moment that there seemed to be something going on here. Were these hospitals just not prepared? Did they not have enough testing kits? Were they running out of tests? Had they tested so many people that they didn’t have any tests left? Were they just not counting people anymore because they weren’t even diagnosing them? And if she wasn’t diagnosed with this illness, then maybe she wasn’t even included in the official count. And one other thing really stuck with me from my interview with Mr. Wei. And that was that the hospital, according to him, told them that his mother’s body had to be burned immediately, had to be cremated immediately. [CHATTER]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd what does that tell you? What does that mean to you that they’re burning these bodies?\n\njavier hernández\n\nIt began to put in my head the sense that the hospital workers were beginning to think that this illness was contagious. And the fact that they wanted that body burned immediately began to suggest that perhaps they thought it posed a threat to other people. Her death got us thinking about whether there were other people like her. And when you went online and search social media, you could quickly find others who were reporting similar experiences — people saying that they went to hospitals, they brought their sick relatives and were simply turned away. We began to kind of add things up, and it seemed like the numbers weren’t right.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo at this point, it sounds like your skepticism is growing, and it’s sounding pretty warranted. So what do you do next?\n\njavier hernández\n\nSo I head back to my hotel and start to try to make sense of all of this. And as I’m sitting there in my room, I begin to see these reports emerging on social media —\n\narchived recording For the first time since the mysterious pneumonia-like illness broke out in China, the country’s health authorities admitted the disease could be contagious.\n\njavier hernández\n\n— that one of China’s top health experts has acknowledged that this virus is now spreading from person to person, which had never been the case before.\n\narchived recording (zhong nanshan) [SPEAKING CHINESE] archived recording (translator) We considered risks of this before, but now evidence has confirmed that it is contagious among humans.\n\njavier hernández\n\nAnd he’s an 83-year-old guy that they dug out of retirement essentially. He was a renowned expert during the SARS crisis. And suddenly, he’s all over social media, telling people that this crisis is much worse than had been previously known.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo this doctor is very much validating what you have been hearing.\n\njavier hernández\n\nYes. He’s saying that there was even a case where one patient was able to infect 14 medical workers.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\njavier hernández\n\nAnd I begin to see the panic kind of spread across social media.\n\narchived recording 1 Say I have coronavirus. Could I give it to you right now? archived recording 2 It’s possible, if you’re coughing and sneezing. If you have a fever, it can be transmitted. archived recording 3 But the spread of Corona virus is accelerating.\n\njavier hernández\n\nThis is the moment when the world begins to wake up.\n\narchived recording 1 Meanwhile, new cases are being confirmed outside of China as well. archived recording 2 Thailand has reported the first case of the Wuhan coronavirus found outside of China. archived recording 3 — because now they’re talking Thailand, Singapore, possibly Scotland. The U.K. is bracing for it to go in there. We have airports here in the United States very concerned about it — archived recording 4 That are doing surveillance. archived recording 5 — here in New York, Chicago and L.A. Every day it seems growing exponentially. archived recording 6 It is. It’s growing.\n\njavier hernández\n\nThe numbers after that point just keep spiraling and spiraling.\n\narchived recording 1 The number of people who have died — archived recording 2 The death toll climbing once again overnight. archived recording 3 The death toll from a deadly viral outbreak of the new coronavirus — archived recording 4 26 deaths so far from the — archived recording 5 — has now passed 40. archived recording 6 [SPEAKING CHINESE] archived recording 7 It’s not just Chinese people who are worried. Everyone is worried. They’re all afraid of dying.\n\njavier hernández\n\nYou just hear people wondering whether the virus is ever going to be contained.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back. And Javier, what are you thinking and feeling at this moment? Because you’re in this city. You’re interacting with people who are taking care of those who are sickened and infected by this illness.\n\njavier hernández\n\nYeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAre you anxious?\n\njavier hernández\n\nWell I’m beginning to feel like this is much worse than I thought. And I think a sense of paranoia can easily settle in sometimes in these situations. I had masks. I was washing my hands all the time. But I couldn’t help but think about every button in the elevator that I touched, every surface and every cough or sniffle that I saw around me. The virus could be anywhere, so I had to be careful.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI mean, understandably.\n\njavier hernández\n\nSo I finished up my reporting, and I grabbed a flight back to Beijing.\n\narchived recording Just one day before China’s massive Lunar New Year holiday, as hundreds of millions crisscross the country to celebrate with families, an unprecedented act.\n\njavier hernández\n\nAnd then the very next day, I hear —\n\narchived recording Today, the entire city of Wuhan, population 11 million, is on lockdown.\n\njavier hernández\n\nThe Chinese government has placed this entire city under lockdown.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\narchived recording Trains, flights, buses, and ferries have been canceled. Even public transport within Wuhan has ground to a halt.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo the city you have just left has basically told everybody else who remains that they’re not going anywhere.\n\njavier hernández\n\nRight. This city is being closed off in a way that China has never done before — or even any other major modern city, really, hasn’t done it in recent times.\n\narchived recording Across China tonight, an expanding lockdown to contain an epidemic.\n\njavier hernández\n\nAnd it was quickly becoming clear to the government that this wasn’t just a local problem.\n\narchived recording Travel bans in over a dozen cities affecting 35 million people.\n\njavier hernández\n\nThey quickly expanded it to not just Wuhan, but to other cities, so that there were tens of millions of people who were essentially forced to stay at home and not allowed to go out. They’ve just put in place the biggest lockdown that we’ve ever seen and what experts are saying is the biggest experiment in public health that they’ve ever seen.\n\narchived recording 1 Despite their efforts, authorities say the virus has not been stopped. archived recording 2 Much depends on whether the measures set in place by the Chinese government will prove effective.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt’s hard to imagine most any other country being able to mount that kind of a response. I mean, I’m just trying to fathom an American city somehow being locked down.\n\njavier hernández\n\nSo this is what it looks like when China’s authoritarian system is in full force. There’s no choice for people to leave. Many people are stuck there. They are going to hospitals that are overcrowded, but they can’t get the health care they need. Doctors are complaining about a lack of medical supplies and critical items like masks and goggles. And you get the sense that people are kind of stuck with what they have, and that’s the bargain they’ve made by living in this system. They have no choice but to follow the government’s orders. They can’t push back. They can’t swim against the current here. Everyone’s essentially forced to comply with this mass lockdown.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou know, from everything we’ve learned about China and its authoritarian government, it seems like it controls every aspect of its citizens’ lives and it surveils every aspect of citizens’ lives. And you’ve just walked us through how they were able to essentially suddenly drop a wall around Wuhan. So knowing all that, shouldn’t China’s government have been able to identify and control this outbreak before it got out of hand?\n\njavier hernández\n\nYou would think that, because the government is so well known for being able to pull off these massive displays of citizen mobilization — it’s been known to be able to pull off these technological feats. But at the same time, there’s a flip side of this coin, which is that China’s authoritarian culture, in many ways, set the stage for this crisis.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\njavier hernández\n\nWell for decades, China has built this system, this ruthless system in which if you are an official in the Communist Party, you are expected to be almost perfect. If anything goes bad, you are the one who is going to take responsibility. You are the one who is going to fall. And this has created an incentive system where local officials fear saying anything about bad news. They worry that if they are found to have done something wrong, that they will lose their power. So in a situation like this, the incentive is to cover up. It’s to conceal. It’s to delay. It’s to try to get a handle on these problems on your own, hoping that perhaps nobody will ever hear about it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo by the time something like, say, a medical crisis gets really big, it may be too late for the local officials who have been trying to contain it themselves and keep it from Beijing.\n\njavier hernández\n\nExactly. These kinds of dynamics played a huge role in the scale of the SARS outbreak. It was clear in this case that local officials knew exactly what was going on. They knew that people were dying of this illness. But for months and months, they didn’t want to report it up the chain. Instead, they tried to cover it up. They tried to see if they could perhaps deal with it secretly, and maybe nobody would ever find out about it. They hoped that Beijing would know about it. But eventually it broke.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo did China learn from that experience with SARS, that dynamic that led to that breakdown, that cover-up?\n\njavier hernández\n\nChina said it would make a lot of changes to its system after the SARS crisis. It said that it would expand its disease reporting system so that these kinds of reports from the local provinces would come to the central government in a more timely fashion. They promised to be more transparent in the release of data and other things. But what they didn’t change was this authoritarian culture, where people fear bringing bad news. And so that has actually gotten worse under President Xi.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhy?\n\njavier hernández\n\nHe has made himself out to be the most powerful leader since Mao. He is somebody who’s always speaking about this great ascendant moment for China in which China is going to be this superpower. And anything that goes against Xi’s vision of this harmonious, resurgent China is going to be seen as a problem. And the people who are creating that problem will pay the consequences. And when I was there in Wuhan, I could sense the fear just rippling across all parts of the society. There were people like the ambulance doctor, who was afraid of challenging the official statistics. There were hospitals that seemed to be paralyzed, that didn’t want to test patients for fear of knowing the results. They didn’t want to be seen as speaking out or telling the truth or bringing this unsavory story into public view.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo that had trickled down all the way to the frontline health care workers, who are supposed to be treating this and sounding the alarm.\n\njavier hernández\n\nRight. They’re fearful of being seen as responsible for this crisis. They don’t want to stand out. And when you think about where this virus might be headed next — to other provinces, to other cities — you have to wonder if these same dynamics would be playing out again. If people will stay silent, if they will not report official cases, because they fear for their jobs and they fear for their livelihoods.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo it seems like whatever reforms the Chinese government made after the failures of SARS, that in the end, none of them really matter, because it hasn’t changed the problem that’s at the root of this.\n\njavier hernández\n\nAt the root of all this is a sense of fear that is both the Communist Party’s strength, but it’s also a huge weakness. They can mobilize entire cities to be on lockdown. They can convince people to stay indoors. They can scrub social media of information that counters their narrative. That’s all very effective when you’re trying to get the public behind your policies. But at the end of the day, the fear is also a huge vulnerability. It creates this system where people are unwilling to speak out, unwilling to bring problems that are really important and that affect people’s lives.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. I mean, for the Chinese leadership, that works until it doesn’t, right? Until you very much need for people to stop being afraid and to speak out about something like a public health crisis.\n\njavier hernández\n\nExactly. And so when you look at the culture, you wonder whether China can actually contain these viruses, whether we will continue to live in a world where the internal politics of the party are going to put lives around the world in danger.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nJavier, thank you.\n\njavier hernández\n\nThanks, Michael.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Wednesday, the total number of people infected by the coronavirus in mainland China surpassed those infected with the SARS virus during that epidemic. As of Wednesday evening, the virus had infected more than 6,000 people in mainland China. Later today, the World Health Organization will convene its emergency committee to determine whether the outbreak amounts to a public health emergency of international concern, its most severe classification. We’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. The Times reports that the White House has sent former national security adviser, John Bolton, a letter, warning him not to publish a book in which he recounts speaking to President Trump about the quid pro quo with Ukraine at the heart of the impeachment trial. In the letter, the White House claims that the book contains significant amounts of classified information that could harm U.S. national security. The letter was sent before The Times published a story describing the book’s contents, a story that has further fueled calls for Bolton to testify in the Senate trial. Senators are expected to vote on whether to call witnesses like Bolton later today.\n\n[music]",

Percent infected by 25 50 75% No control measures Some control measures Severe control measures Three scenarios for how the outbreak could spread. Percent infected by 25 50 75%\n\nThe coronavirus has infected far more people in the United States than testing has shown so far, and stringent measures to limit social contact in parts of the country not yet seeing many cases are needed to significantly stem the tide of illness and death in the coming months.\n\nThose are the conclusions of Columbia University researchers who used a New York Times database of known cases and Census Bureau transportation data to model how the outbreak could evolve based on what is known about the virus. The estimates are inherently uncertain, and they could change as America adopts unprecedented measures to control the outbreak.\n\nBut they offer a stark warning: Even if the country cut its rate of transmission in half — a tall order — some 650,000 people might become infected in the next two months.\n\nThe growth is driven by Americans with mild symptoms who are carrying and spreading the virus without being aware that they have it, the researchers say. The number of undetected cases — 11 times more than has been officially reported, they estimate — reflects how far behind the United States has fallen in testing for the virus.\n\nNew York City, Seattle, Boston and parts of California already have such large outbreaks that they will probably see significant growth even after taking extraordinary measures over the past week, the researchers say. New York City’s outbreak, the nation’s largest, grew to more than 4,000 known cases on Friday and is likely to increase many times over even in a favorable scenario.\n\nHow Control Measures Could Slow the Outbreak New cases per day No control measures 500K 400K Some control measures 300K 200K The U.S. is now reporting thousands of cases per day. 100K Severe control measures 2/21 3/22 4/21 5/21 6/20 7/20 New cases per day No control measures 500K 400K Some control measures 300K 200K The U.S. is now reporting thousands of cases per day. 100K Severe control measures Feb. 21 March 22 April 21 May 21 June 20 July 20 By The New York Times · Source: Sen Pei and Jeffrey Shaman, Columbia University\n\nOn the other hand, parts of the country without large clusters of cases could still avoid the worst of the outbreak — if they impose measures like closing schools, banning mass gatherings and testing and quarantining sick people and their contacts. The epidemic would then spread inland at a much slower pace and strike with less severity, the estimates say.\n\nBut controls would need to be put in place immediately, and everywhere.\n\n“We’re looking at something that’s catastrophic on a level that we have not seen for an infectious disease since 1918,” said Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia and the leader of the research team, referring to the Spanish flu. “And it’s requiring sacrifices we haven’t seen since World War II. There are going to be enormous disruptions. There’s no easy way out.”\n\nWhere the outbreak could spread Total new infections by day Total: 10 100 1,000 No intervention Without control measures, the outbreak might sweep across most of the country by early May.

Severe control measures The outbreak could be limited in areas that do not now have large numbers of known cases. Severe control measures The outbreak could be limited in areas that do not now have large numbers of known cases. By The New York Times\n\nControls in many places have already changed the fabric of American life. Restaurants and schools have closed, people are working from home and travelers have put off trips — all changes that should reduce the rate of infection. In California, New York and Illinois, officials have announced more stringent directives aimed at stopping the spread. That means that at least 1 in 5 Americans will be under orders to stay home in the coming days, and more states are expected to follow suit.\n\nBut other places have resisted. Bars and restaurants remain open in Wichita, Kan., in a county that reported its first case on Thursday night, and in Knoxville, Tenn., where reports of the virus have been scarce. Some malls remain open in Chicago, recreational marijuana shops in Oregon, and some retail chains nationwide. Many businesses are still requiring workers to come into the office.\n\n“I’m not really supportive yet of restricting things further or closing down,” said Pete Meitzner, head of the Board of County Commissioners in Sedgwick County, which includes Wichita, a city of about 400,000. Mr. Meitzner said he was growing increasingly anxious at the possibility that people who do not know they are ill might spread the virus, but that he also needed to consider the fate of workers as the community decided whether to close buildings.\n\n“Some of our public offices and buildings are, but I do feel horrible for our restaurant workers and our hospitality workers at our hotels,” he said. “They are really suffering.”\n\nOf the area’s relative dearth of cases, Mr. Meitzner added, “We don’t know for sure if we’re lucky or what.”\n\nThe scenarios do not estimate what effect individual local actions will have on the outbreak. But if the country as a whole does not take collective action, they suggest that Sedgwick County could see a significant proportion of its population — hundreds of thousands of people — infected with the virus in the next two months. If the country, as a whole, can reduce rates of transmission by 50 percent, Sedgwick County could instead see fewer than 1,000 cases in that time.\n\nThe rate of new infections varies by state New cases per capita by day, sorted by peak time By The New York Times · Source: Sen Pei and Jeffrey Shaman, Columbia University\n\nSeveral researchers not involved in the Columbia University analysis who reviewed the findings said they made sense and broadly agreed with their own thinking. Even in places that now appear to have few cases, they said, officials should act sooner rather than later.\n\n“You have to think of this as an insurance for the future: The earlier you do it, the greater effect you have on the virus,” said Alessandro Vespignani, director of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University, who said the estimates were in line with his own projections. “It’s better to take excessive precautions than not.”\n\nThe economic challenges of that loom.\n\n“We’re staying open until someone forces us to shut down,” Beau McKee, the general manager at Not Watson’s Kitchen and Bar in Knoxville, said in a telephone interview, as dishes clattered in the background. “I feel like those people that are vulnerable know who they are and they should be careful, and we should continue testing. But small businesses are getting crushed.”\n\nMr. McKee said he has grown increasingly worried about how the virus could affect his own father, in his 70s, but that there were other worries too. “At least we can offer a handful of people good-paying jobs and when we get out of this and we’re on the other side, we’ll hopefully have gained more clientele by doing so because we kind of stuck it out and didn’t wave the white flag,” he said.\n\nThe Columbia researchers’ model works by observing the behavior of the outbreak in the United States up until March 13, based on case records compiled by The New York Times, commuting patterns and other data.\n\nThe researchers use those observations to infer key features of the outbreak. One is how many people each infected person has tended to infect so far, about 2.2. Another is how many people may pass on the virus without knowing that they have it. The disease is spreading far too fast to be explained by known cases alone, and only about 1 in 11 infections have been reported, they found.\n\nThose factors allow the researchers to simulate the spread of a virus in the future. They adjust those simulations under different scenarios in which the nation imposes a range of control measures to stop the spread.\n\nThe estimates are imperfect, but they are consistent with the available data. It is impossible to know the exact number of cases a week ago or to predict the future. It is also impossible to model the precise impact of unprecedented measures that America has already put in place to control the outbreak.\n\nBut the research estimates that if measures to slow the disease are not effective, the virus could sicken millions of people or more, losing steam on the coasts in May before spreading to the rest of the country over the summer.\n\nA worst-case scenario is unlikely to play out. A handful of countries, including China and South Korea, have managed to slow down their own fast-moving outbreaks through tracking and isolating sick people and reducing social contact. It is not known if measures imposed in the last week have started slowing the outbreak in the United States.\n\nBut the researchers’ estimates show the enormity of the task. As in China, most of those who have been infected but not tested are likely to have mild symptoms, or none at all, the researchers say. That means they can spread the virus without being aware they are infected.\n\nSeveral researchers said that the slow pace of testing in the United States is one major reason the proportion of unreported infections is so high here. Despite a ramping up of testing in recent days, the United States still lags both Italy and South Korea in the total number of people tested and in testing per-capita, figures show.\n\nThis map shows how many people the model estimates could get the virus in each county in the United States by two months from now.\n\nOne scenario — which is unlikely — simulates what could happen without any intervention. A second scenario envisions what would happen with some control measures, such as partial adherance to social distancing guidlines and a patchwork of government-imposed restrictions on work, travel, and dining out. A third envisions severe control measures: strict adherance across the country to social distancing, working remotely, closing schools and restaurants and banning large gatherings.\n\nThree scenarios for each county These are rough estimates of how the virus could spread, but they are inherently uncertain, especially many months in the future. Projections are based on case reports as of March 13. No transmission reduction Some control measures Severe control measures No transmission reduction Some control measures Severe control measures + - Estimated infection rate 5 25 50 75% + - By The New York Times · Source: Sen Pei and Jeffrey Shaman, Columbia University\n\nNew York City, the model indicates, could count tens of thousands of new cases every day by late spring or early summer. But if the city remains vigilant about maintaining the stringent measures recently put in place, the peak could be delayed by weeks or longer and be significantly lower, the model suggests. Dr. Shaman cautioned that the model is designed to capture national trends, and local projections should be viewed as broad estimates.\n\n“This is serious and this is real. We have to act now and act aggressive,” Dr. Vespignani said. “We have to mobilize all the resources that we have. None of us has a single solution. But we have to try all of them.”\n\nIn the days since New York’s first recorded case, on March 1, the state has declared a state of emergency and deployed the National Guard to New Rochelle, an early focal point of the outbreak; New York City has closed schools and barred dining in at restaurants and watching Broadway shows.\n\nBut in places like Wichita, some parts of life have yet to change. In that city, bars and restaurants are allowed to operate freely as long as they keep crowds to fewer than 50 people.\n\nStill, Beverly Salas, an owner of Egg Cetera, a downtown restaurant that serves brunch and late-night bites for the bar crowd, said she chose to close the restaurant anyway. “It was a hard decision, honestly, because we have no more income coming in,” Ms. Salas, 24, said. But her customers include nurses from a nearby hospital and many people who are in their 60s or older, she said, and the thought that someone might somehow contract the illness at her small restaurant was too much for her to bear.\n\n“I’m looking at other places like Italy and trying to avoid going through that,” she said. “Why are we not taking it as seriously as New York, Chicago, or even Kansas City? I know we’re a smaller town, but there are cases all over the country.”",

Governor Cuomo shifts his emphasis to the health care system —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nToday: A conversation with Governor Andrew Cuomo. It’s Wednesday, March 18. So I want to thank you for letting us —\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nI’m just examining —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nExamining the microphone? That’s a windscreen. It’ll keep your —\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nKeep the wind down.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe wind down.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nBecause it’s windy.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Governor, I want to thank you for letting us in in the middle of an extraordinary crisis, and tell you how much we appreciate it. I want to start this conversation by asking you where New York is in this pandemic? It’s Tuesday afternoon, around 3 o’clock. How many New Yorkers do we understand have the coronavirus at this point?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nWe have, right now, over 1,000 cases. It’s a little misleading, because we’re talking about these tests as if it’s taking a random sample, right? But it’s not. The test results are purely symbolic of how many tests you’re taking. We are now taking more tests than most states, and we’re finding more positives, which would make sense, also. Because we are the dense state, and this is a function of density at the end of the day. You’re getting on a subway train, you’re getting on a bus, you’re in a crowded restaurant, you’re in a crowded office space. And this transfers in the crowds. So that it would be here first is not surprising. That it would communicate most easily here is not surprising. And that we would have the sophisticated health system that would detect it here first is not surprising.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo if these are the front lines of this epidemic, and I’ve heard you describe this as a kind of war that we’re in right now, what stage of the war are we at in a place like New York?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nWe are seeing the enemy on the horizon, and they are approaching very quickly, and we don’t have our defenses in place.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe don’t.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nWe don’t. Testing was the first level of defense, right? The testing was slow nationwide. We’re now ramping up in this state because the federal government, I think, made a wise decision. We were the first to ask for it. I asked the president for it directly. Basically said, decentralize the testing, leave it to the states. We have 200 laboratories in this state. I said, decentralize it, let the states do it.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut you weren’t allowed at first.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nRight. The federal government was controlling it, and you were running all the national tests through the C.D.C., which was then sending them to Atlanta. So we’re now ramping up on testing, that’s why our numbers are high. But testing is no longer going to keep the genie in the bottle, right? The genie is out of the bottle now. Where this all comes down to is, when they talk about flattening the curve, flattening the curve, they’re trying to slow the advance of the enemy until we can get enough of our defenses in place. What are the defenses? A health care system that can handle the injured, to torture the metaphor. And we’re not there. If you look at the speed, the increase in the rate, the spike in the increase of the number of cases, we’re looking at a possibility of an apex being about 45 days away.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe peak of this pandemic here?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nThe peak. That’s one projection — 45 days. Needing 110,000 hospital beds. In this state, you have 50,000 hospital beds. Needing 37,000 intensive care unit beds, and having 3,000 I.C.U. beds.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNeeding 37,000, having three.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat’s a pretty extraordinary gap.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nYes. Because the injured here are going to be predominantly senior citizens, compromised immune systems, underlying illness. And those people need I.C.U.s. When they come into the hospital, they don’t need a normal bed and moderate health care. They need an I.C.U.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo I want to talk about your leadership in this war, to similarly torture the metaphor. The work you’ve done in the last few days to flatten the curve. Because you’ve made some extraordinary decisions in the past 72 hours or so. Efforts to essentially start shutting down systematically elements of our life here in New York. So help me understand the information that you’ve been receiving, the calculations that you’ve been weighing, and the very real trade-offs that you understood would have to be made.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nI’m watching the increase in cases. And you take one measure, and you see what the effect was. You take another measure, and you see what the effect was. And nothing was having an effect. Nothing we were doing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat steps did you take that were not effective?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nThe testing was supposed to be step one. That was supposed to slow the spread. That didn’t work. OK, the enemy keeps coming. You start moderate social distancing. Businesses, voluntary basis, work from home. That didn’t make any difference. The numbers have kept going up regardless of everything we did. When you keep seeing those numbers increase, your efforts have to become more and more dramatic. Yesterday, we went to the point of closing bars, restaurants, gyms and schools, with the precaution of providing child care for essential workers, especially nurses, health care workers. The next level of efforts to control density, control the spread, would be to start closing — mandatory closing — of businesses.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLet me focus in on that decision. Bars, restaurants. Because that is billions of dollars in lost revenue. It’s tens of thousands of people out of work. On my way here, I got a text from a friend who said he had just laid off 90 employees. And he was crying the whole time he had to do it. So let’s talk about how you made that decision because of the impact that that is immediately going to have — it’s a huge part of the economy in the state. And so how did you get to that decision?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nMichael, you are past the point of monetizing these decisions.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat do you mean?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nYou are at a point of deciding how many people are going to live, how many people are going to die? That’s where you are. Closing restaurants reduces the spread of the disease. The disease transfers very quickly, not just in the cough and the droplets, et cetera. There are some studies that say that disease can live — the virus can live up to two or three days on a surface.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLike a table at a restaurant.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nJust think about that. Like a table in a restaurant, like a sink, like a handrail, in a bus. Two or three days. It’s why this virus is so vicious. And we know the trajectory right now overwhelms the hospital system. Three or four-fold. It’s not even close. People will die because they can’t get the health care service they need.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you’re reducing the number of people who die because they can’t get into a hospital bed, for every restaurant you close and every transmission you prevent in closing that restaurant.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat’s the thing. It’s just pure numbers.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nYes. And it’s not even just New York. The whole nation is past the point of, let’s try to save money, right? You look at the Dow Jones market, you look at all the businesses that are closing. This is now a national phenomenon that this economy is going to be very badly hurt. The recovery of this economy is going to be an economic feat never seen before. You’re going to have to go back to the Great Depression to come up with a revival plan for the economy like we’re seeing now. You’re going to see mortgage foreclosures, you’re going to see bankruptcies, you’re going to see massive unemployment claims all across the board.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI don’t see you sugarcoating this at all.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nNo. This is going to be — our state finances are decimated, right? How does the state work? A state is just a percentage of every other business.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nThose businesses are all closed. Or their revenues have been cut by 50, 60, 70 percent. But I think the good thing, as a nation, is we said, so what? So what? What value on a human life? If I can save here 5,000 lives, 10,000 lives, I don’t care what it costs, Michael. That’s what I’m going to do.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nI wonder what you want to say to somebody who has just lost their job, because there are now a lot of them, who may not be able to pay their rent, who may not be able to pay their mortgage, who may lose their housing, and who are really scared because of these economic consequences. What do you want them to hear you say?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nI would say first, I hope no one in your family, or no one you know, dies because of this. Because that’s what we’re trying to accomplish. I hope no one in your family dies. Second, we all understand the economic consequences. It’s not just you, it is everyone. And by the way, take solace in that fact. Because maybe if it was just you, you could be forgotten and left on the side of the road. It’s not just you. It’s everyone, and it’s everywhere. The Italians have an old saying that the rich man is the man who has health, right? If you have your health, you can figure anything else out. And it’s true. We’ll figure out the economy. I went through 9/11. Oh, downtown Manhattan is devastated, we have to rebuild, how do we do this? We’re alive, first of all. And if we are alive, we’ll figure out the rest. We’ll figure out the money. It’s making sure we live through this.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back. Governor, I want to understand how you’re thinking about something else, which is hospitals, supplies and readiness. You’ve started to signal that there’s a major shortage of I.C.U. units. What about respirators? What does the picture start to look like in a couple of weeks, and are we ready for it?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nWe are not ready for it, certainly, today. The picture looks like you have tens of thousands of people coming to the hospital. These are respiratory illnesses. They can’t breathe. They need an I.C.U. bed with a ventilator. OK, buy more ventilators. OK, you can’t.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou can’t.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nBecause the entire world is trying to buy ventilators.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo you’ve tried to buy ventilators?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nWe try every which way to buy ventilators. We’re trying to go to China, which is now over it, trying to buy their ventilators.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nI mean, it is a global competition to buy ventilators. The federal government has an emergency medical stockpile. I reached out to the president. Federal cooperation is everything, Michael, because it’s whatever the federal government has in that stockpile is going to be our main access.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDid you ask to tap into the stockpile?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThen what did the president say?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIf I can ask.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nHe has said he will be very helpful. We’re looking at the Army Corps of Engineers to try to build additional hospital beds, convert dormitories, et cetera. Because you’re overwhelming the capacity of the health care system by two or three times. You need backup staff, backup nurses, backup doctors, more space, more equipment, more gloves, more food, more everything.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIs there a version where hospitals can handle this influx? Or is it just a matter of how short they fall?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nThere is no way they can handle this.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo then, do you accept that some incredibly difficult decisions are going to have to be made inside hospitals in the coming days? Decisions of who lives and who dies, who gets a bed, who doesn’t, who gets a respirator, who doesn’t get a respirator. Who to prioritize. Is that something doctors should be deciding, or is that something government should be playing a role in?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nIt will be a question of triage. Remember, most of these people will have serious underlying conditions already. And in some ways, it will become self-selecting, depending on how ill you were when you came in.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight, but when the decision has to be made, do I put the 85-year-old with underlying conditions in the I.C.U., who might have a 50-50 chance, or do I put a 45-year-old in the I.C.U. who’s come in with respiratory problems who has a 60 percent chance? We just talked to a doctor in Italy who had to make these choices. Do you want to be the one issuing protocols? Do you want the president to be issuing those protocols? Who should be guiding those kind of awful decisions?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nWell, I pray we don’t get there. But if we get there, it should be a medical decision, unless God intervenes and God makes the determination first.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWhat is the ideal role of the federal government right now, in your mind?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nRight now, crank up the Army Corps of Engineers, which does have building capacity. Add to hospital capacity in the states that need it — New York would be at the top of the list. That’s what they do, right? They build the infrastructure for war. They go into a country where nothing exists, they cut down trees, they build roads, they build camps. Because the states don’t have the capacity or the resources. I don’t have a workforce. Mobilized FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has tremendous potential when it works well, right? FEMA did Hurricane Katrina, which was FEMA not doing a good job. FEMA can be extraordinarily good when it’s staffed and funded. So we need them fully deployed here.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd are they doing that?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nThe president has now — I believe yesterday, the president’s tone was 100 percent serious. He showed more sobriety on this issue than he has shown. I spoke with him twice today already. I know he has his team working. I was on the phone with him late last night, early this morning. So I believe he is fully committed, and he understands the role and he understands the severity. And that is good news.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nLet me ask you directly, what do you think of President Trump’s leadership in this moment? It began with some skepticism about the severity of the situation. It has changed, like you just signaled. Is the president your partner here?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nYeah. Let me say this. I have had a tumultuous relationship with this president. I have opposed many of his policies, vociferously. You could probably say there has been no governor in the country who has been as aggressive in his opposition to the president as I have. Both ideologically and practically. And I probably have sued the president more than any governor in the United States. So having said that, I said to the president again this morning, look, forget everything. Forget Democrats, forget Republicans. We’re Americans, and that always came first. And that’s where we are. I put out my hand in partnership. I need your help. I’m grateful for your help. I’ll be a committed partner. Let’s get this done. Let’s save lives.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDid he say anything to make you feel like that was to be reciprocated?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nYes. Yes. He said — yes, exactly. This country has gotten itself into this hyperpartisan hype. This ideological intensity. And I understand why. It has been for me too, in truth. But then something happens and it changes your whole perspective. Right? You can be fighting in your family, with your siblings, and I’m not going to go to your birthday party, and I’m not going — and then the parent dies, and you say to each other, what have we been doing? What a waste of time.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou think we’re at a moment that may transcend?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nYou’re talking about Americans dying here. That’s what you’re talking about. Americans dying. Forget everything else. Life is as life and death, and that changes your perspective. We can have the arguments another day. It also changes, by the way, your perspective on government. Think about this. When was the last time this country actually needed government? Needed it. Needed it to be competent and qualified and needed leaders to be real leaders. Not celebrity leaders, not good-looking, handsome, charismatic leaders. I like this one. This one’s sexy. This one’s funny. It’s a totally different lens. No, this thing called government is very serious. This is serious business. You have to know what you’re doing, you have to know how to mobilize — what is this Army Corps of Engineers, and FEMA, and how do you build a hospital in 45 days, and how do you do triage, and how do you make all these things happen in state local relations, and passing emergency appropriations, and how do you get emergency funding for purchasing, and emergency orders? Wow, I didn’t even know government did that.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. This is what government is actually for.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nYes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd every so often, we have a moment that demonstrates why government exists.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nYes. And it doesn’t matter until it matters.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight. Is there more coming, Governor? What kind of measures should your constituents — should all New Yorkers, and maybe even people beyond New York — be getting ready to take on? As we walked into this room, we got word, for example, that it looks like New York is going to essentially order a shelter-in-place condition, which means, basically, you can’t leave your house. What more is coming?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nYes. That is not going to happen, shelter in place. For New York City, or any city or county to take an emergency action, the state has to approve it. And I wouldn’t approve shelter in place. That scares people, right? Quarantine in place, you can’t leave your home. The fear, the panic, is a bigger problem than the virus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt is?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nYes. And I shut that down immediately. The density control measures would be more — we’re going to close businesses.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYou’re going to potentially close all businesses?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nPotentially. Potentially. Italy took the most drastic density control, that only essential businesses — grocery stores, first responders, pharmacies, et cetera. But I am against quarantines, you must stay in your home. You can come out of your house, just don’t be in a crowded situation, don’t cause more density, don’t sneeze in someone’s face within 6 feet.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nGo walk in the park. I mean that as a nice thing. That’s a positive suggestion, you go walk in the park.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNo, I try to take an evening walk. I appreciate that.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nThe old neighborhood, they used to say, go take a walk in the park. That was a bad thing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIn Queens.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nIn Queens.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIf we’re at a moment where it’s too late to look back and say, if only we had done this, if only we had done that, and instead, we’re at a moment where, even if the government steps up in every way we want it to, everyone now has to do their part as well. What’s your message to them?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nFirst of all, welcome to life. If I had only done this, if I had only done this, if I had only done this. That’s life, my brother. That’s all of us. I forget that. You’re here, now. What do you do now? And that’s all that matters. The enemy has not advanced to a point where they are in the foxhole, right? We still have some time.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nNot much.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nNot much. But what we do between now and then matters gravely. Do everything you can. Do everything you can to flatten that curve. Yes, your friend who owns the restaurant, I’m sure is very angry at me.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm hmm.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nBut you know what? I did it because I believe it was necessary to save lives. We’re going to have to take more actions like that to reduce the density and flatten the curve. Do everything you can to build more hospital beds in 45 days. Well, it’s impossible. Yeah, well, I’m going to try my damnedest to show you it’s not impossible. Do everything that you can humanly possibly do. Extend your imagination in a way you never thought. Extend your ambition beyond yourself. Because it’s not about you, it’s about us. It’s about the collective. It’s about society. Don’t expose yourself to other people. Don’t indulge yourself. Yeah, I know you really want to go out and go shopping and then — yeah, I know you do. But don’t think of just yourself. Save as many lives as you can.\n\n[music]\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nBe responsible, be civic-minded, be kind, be considerate, think of one another. Yes, we’re going to have an inconvenient period for a few months. We are. Deal with it. And deal with it gracefully. And deal with it with kindness and intelligence.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nGovernor, I really appreciate your time. Thank you for having us in.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nThank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd good luck getting through all this.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nThank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’re going to walk in this office, but keep our space.\n\nlisa tobin\n\nCan I just ask a quick question? If it says New York City tells 8 million people to be prepared to shelter in place, that is not going to happen?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nNo.\n\nlisa tobin\n\nBut it’s playing on the television right now.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nYeah, I know. I know.\n\nlisa tobin\n\nWhat are you going to do?\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nYeah, I don’t know anyone at CNN. Yeah. But see how scary that is?\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nYour brother is an anchor on CNN.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nThat was a joke. Bada boom. Bada boom.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBada boom.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nI normally hold up a little sign, saying joke coming.\n\nlisa tobin\n\nNo, but — I’m sorry to interrupt, but in all seriousness, if that’s on CNN —\n\nspeaker\n\nWe already put a statement out that said that we were not considering it.\n\nlisa tobin\n\nOK.\n\nspeaker\n\nSo it’ll be clarified, hopefully in the next five minutes.\n\nlisa tobin\n\nOK.\n\nandrew cuomo\n\nBut that’s why the fear, why the panic? Because you watch things like that all day. And everybody — somebody says something, and then it’s on the screen right away. Oh my god, I’m going to be locked in my home. I better go to the store and buy stuff. And now the stores —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe’ll be right back. Here’s what else you need to know today. On Tuesday, dozens of countries moved to close their borders, to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\narchived recording (ursula von der leyen) The less travel, the more we can contain the virus. Therefore, I propose to the heads of state and government to introduce temporary restriction on nonessential travel to the European Union.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe European Union voted to shut off at least 26 of its nations to nearly all outside visitors for at least 30 days and perhaps longer. While Russia will bar entry to most foreigners, starting today. In the United States, where thousands of businesses have stopped operating over the past few days, the Trump administration said it was racing to stimulate the economy, to stave off a deep recession.\n\narchived recording (steve mnuchin) We’re looking at sending checks to Americans immediately. And what we’ve heard from hardworking Americans, many companies have now shut down, whether it’s bars or restaurants. Americans need cash now, and the president wants to get cash now.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nDuring a news conference, Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin outlined a plan under negotiation with Congress for direct payments to Americans.\n\narchived recording (steve mnuchin) And I mean now, in the next two weeks. archived recording How much? archived recording (steve mnuchin) There’s some numbers out there. They may be a little bit bigger than what’s in the press.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMeanwhile, on Tuesday night, West Virginia became the 50th state to report an infection. And Joe Biden won all three primaries on Tuesday — in Florida, Illinois and Arizona, dashing Bernie Sanders’s hope of a comeback and solidifying Biden’s lead.\n\narchived recording (joe biden) Now, it’s the moments like these when we realize that we need to put politics aside and work together as Americans.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nOn Tuesday night, Biden devoted much of his victory speech to the pandemic.\n\narchived recording (joe biden) The coronavirus doesn’t care if you’re a Democrat or Republican. It will not discriminate based on national origin, race, gender or your zip code. It will touch people in positions of power, as well as the most vulnerable people in our society. We’re all in this together. This is a moment for each of us.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro",

As the beds fill, “you can admit more patients only with the death of a patient,” but “if a patient dies in a few days, probably that was a patient who did not deserve to be admitted. You are wasting very scarce and precious resources.”\n\nHe said doctors in the country’s hot zone of infections were already focusing on the needs of the total community, a recommendation made in the New England Journal of Medicine paper by the Bergamo doctors.\n\n“If you admit an 82-year-old with hypertension, in a situation where you have two or three patients waiting outside your I.C.U. who have many more chances of survival that you cannot admit because your I.C.U. is full, then it becomes really inappropriate, or I would say, immoral,” he said.\n\nThe recommendations were immediately attacked by officials of the main Italian medical association, many of them outside the hardest-hit areas, who criticized the guidelines as discriminatory against older patients. But Dr. Vergano said he received support from doctors on the front lines, as well as requests for translations from doctors in other countries.\n\n“They were expecting the same destiny,” he said. “Probably with less resources.”\n\nJason Horowitz reported from Rome and David D.

Since then, the virus has sickened tens of thousands of people in more than three dozen countries, and its quick advance across Asia, the Middle East and Europe has raised fears that a pandemic could be on the horizon.\n\nThe World Health Organization has referred to the outbreak as an “epidemic” as opposed to a “pandemic.” But late last month, it increased its assessment of the global risk of spread and the risk of impact of the coronavirus outbreak from “high” to “very high.”\n\nWhat’s the difference between an epidemic and a pandemic?\n\nAccording to the W.H.O., an epidemic is explained as a regional outbreak of an illness that spreads unexpectedly. The C.D.C. calls it “an increase, often sudden, in the number of cases of a disease above what is normally expected” in that area.\n\nIn 2010, the W.H.O. defined a pandemic as “the worldwide spread of a new disease” that affects large numbers of people. The C.D.C. says it is “an epidemic that has spread over several countries or continents, usually affecting a large number of people.”",

    "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000007046988/nursing-home-coronavirus.html",
    "article_text": "“You may have just that one patient with the coronavirus that come into your facility, and you don’t know. I can go to work today, wind up feeding them. And then find out two hours later, ‘Oh, they have that virus.’ And I’ve already been exposed. Nursing Assistants, CNA’s, we’re the closest ones, we’re the front line.” The work of nursing assistants has always been difficult and low paying. But add coronavirus, and it’s become dangerous. TV announcers: “Across the country, nursing homes are especially vulnerable —” “One elder care facility, where 19 residents have died —” “In Palo Alto —” “In the New Orleans area —” “In DuPage County —” “In Sacramento County.” “Covid-19 spreading through our most vulnerable population.” We met up with caregivers from nursing homes in Northern California. They attend to the kind of patients who are most likely to die if they get the virus. “So can you do your job without touching people, or without —” “It’s impossible. Everything is touch.” “Bathing. Feeding.” “Assist them to the restroom.” “Brushing their teeth.” “Turning.” “It’s almost like a holding and cleaning at the same time.” “Helping nurses with wound care.” “Cleaning their ears, tying their shoes.” “We do everything.” “Well, you could be feeding that patient or you could be doing something and the patient starts coughing. It’s too late to turn around, you already done got crap all over you. You know, you just run to the bathroom, wash your face or whatever. And then go about your day. Social distance? Can’t do it. It’s impossible.” If this video were filmed at a different time, you’d be seeing footage of these workers with their patients. But nursing homes are closed to visitors right now to protect the people inside. Actually everything you’re seeing here we filmed from afar, following recommendations to slow the spread of Covid-19. But these caregivers can’t maintain that kind of distance in their work. And now, shortages of protective gear like masks are putting them at risk, not just for getting the virus but for spreading it. “If you want to speak, press star 6.” “We’re running out of supplies of masks in our building. And trying to take care of these patients without us also getting sick is worrisome.” “We’re rationing right now, masks, protective gear. But it’s like, what happens if we run out? It scares me.” “They gave us the N95 mask, and told us to maintain it. If the elastic comes off by accident or something, staple and reuse it.” “So you’re actually cleaning the N95 masks in between uses?” “Yeah, with — with alcohol.” “You like wipe off the outside of it or how do you do that?” “The outside, the inside and just let it air dry, and put it back in a Ziploc bag for the next day.” “A lot of people in this field, we have families. So you don’t want to take nothing home. My granddaughter, she’s special needs. So she has a low immune system. When she was born, she was really sick. So we’ve been cautious ever since she’s been born.” “I am very concerned of taking it home. My mom, she’s diabetic, and my dad also just beat cancer in the thyroid. I have asthma. So if I were to get Covid, It would affect my lungs. And how am I going to pay my bills? Because it’s paycheck to paycheck, what I’m doing.” The pay for this work is low: In the U.S., the median salary is less than $30,000 a year. As a result, many nursing assistants work multiple jobs. And as they move between facilities, so can disease. “Usually when I finish the first job, I go right to the second job. I work 16 hours, that’s not including driving time. And I’m not the only one — majority of my co-workers, they work two jobs.” “I work home health care too, on top of taking care of my mom and my grandmother. I’m kind of worried because you don’t see the virus because they’re droplets, and you don’t know who’s coughing or sneezing on you. Even though I do try to sanitize, like along the way, going to my next client. But sometimes it’s just not enough I think. But who else is going to take care of them?”",

But her doctor did not have the test and advised her that it did not matter whether she had the virus: Either way, she had to stay home.\n\n“From a public policy standpoint, that’s true,” Ms. Karras said. “From an individual standpoint, you really want to know what you have. It was very frustrating to me because we were all trying to do the right thing.”\n\nFinally, Ms. Karras contacted the Seattle Flu Study, a research project to study the spread of influenza in the region. She ordered a kit, sent her sample and heard back: She was positive for the coronavirus. (Since then, the flu study has been told by authorities to stop doing that kind of testing since it is not properly certified.)\n\nEven those who have good reason to think they may be infected are being denied testing.\n\nThe Grand Princess cruise had 21 people on board test positive for the coronavirus.

    "article_text": "The SARS-CoV-2 Coronavirus\n\nThe virus that causes Covid-19 is currently spreading around the world. At least six other types of coronavirus are known to infect humans, with some causing the common cold and two causing outbreaks: SARS and MERS.\n\nSpike\n\nproteins Proteins\n\nand lipids\n\nCovered With Spikes\n\nThe coronavirus is named after the crownlike spikes that protrude from its surface. The virus is enveloped in a bubble of oily lipid molecules, which falls apart on contact with soap.\n\nACE2\n\nEntering a Vulnerable Cell\n\nThe virus enters the body through the nose, mouth or eyes, then attaches to cells in the airway that produce a protein called ACE2. The virus is believed to have originated in bats, where it may have attached to a similar protein.\n\nProtective\n\nwrapping Viral RNA\n\nReleasing Viral RNA\n\nThe virus infects the cell by fusing its oily membrane with the membrane of the cell. Once inside, the coronavirus releases a snippet of genetic material called RNA.\n\nViral protein Viral RNA\n\nHijacking the Cell\n\nThe virus’s genome is less than 30,000 genetic “letters” long. (Ours is over 3 billion.) The infected cell reads the RNA and begins making proteins that will keep the immune system at bay and help assemble new copies of the virus.\n\nAntibiotics kill bacteria and do not work against viruses. But researchers are testing antiviral drugs that might disrupt viral proteins and stop the infection.\n\nCell nucleus Viral proteins\n\nMaking Viral Proteins\n\nAs the infection progresses, the machinery of the cell begins to churn out new spikes and other proteins that will form more copies of the coronavirus.\n\nAssembling New Copies\n\nNew copies of the virus are assembled and carried to the outer edges of the cell.\n\nSpreading the Infection\n\nEach infected cell can release millions of copies of the virus before the cell finally breaks down and dies. The viruses may infect nearby cells, or end up in droplets that escape the lungs.\n\nDebris from\n\ndead cells\n\nImmune Response\n\nMost Covid-19 infections cause a fever as the immune system fights to clear the virus. In severe cases, the immune system can overreact and start attacking lung cells. The lungs become obstructed with fluid and dying cells, making it difficult to breathe. A small percentage of infections can lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome, and possibly death.\n\nLeaving the Body\n\nCoughing and sneezing can expel virus-laden droplets onto nearby people and surfaces, where the virus can remain infectious for several hours to several days. The C.D.C. recommends that people diagnosed with Covid-19 wear masks to reduce the release of viruses. Health care workers and others who care for infected people should wear masks, too.\n\nFlu vaccine Flu antibody Potential\n\ncoronavirus\n\nvaccine Antibodies\n\ntargeting\n\nviruses\n\nA Possible Vaccine\n\nA future vaccine could help the body produce antibodies that target the SARS-CoV-2 virus and prevent it from infecting human cells. The flu vaccine works in a similar way, but antibodies generated from a flu vaccine do not protect against coronavirus.\n\nHow Soap Works\n\nSoap destroys the virus when the water-shunning tails of the soap molecules wedge themselves into the lipid membrane and pry it apart.\n\nThe best way to avoid getting infected with the coronavirus is to wash your hands with soap, avoid touching your face, keep your distance from sick people and regularly clean frequently used surfaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSources: Dr. Matthew B.

    "article_text": "In the Renaissance, Italy was made up of many small territorial states, and travel between them was regularly curtailed because of outbreaks of plague. Travelers moving between regions during these times had to carry health passes issued by local governments testifying that they were traveling from places free of plague.\n\nIn the opening to “The Decameron,” the 14th-century poet and scholar Giovanni Boccaccio described reactions in his native Florence to an outbreak. He lamented that “the reverend authority of the laws, both human and divine, was all in a manner dissolved and fallen into decay.” We should take Boccaccio’s account as a warning. Despite Machiavelli’s call in 1513 for Italian unification in the final pages of “The Prince,” Italy only became a single nation in 1861; its deep regional divisions are still felt politically, linguistically, gastronomically and in the infrastructure of its transit systems.\n\nIn this time of coronavirus, Italy’s national identity — and that of Europe more broadly — is showing signs of strain. In addition to closing off certain towns with clusters of infections, regional governments are working to isolate themselves from the rest of the country. Most notably, the province of Basilicata has imposed a 14-day quarantine on all citizens entering from Piedmont, Lombardy, the Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Liguria. These measures are about much more than health controls. They highlight regional identities and emphasize the tensions between local and national actions being taken to contain Italy’s outbreak.\n\nBeyond the exacerbation of regionalism in Italian society, we should be on guard against the ways that outbreaks of disease have historically led to the persecutions of marginalized people. One of the best documented social outcomes of the plague in late-medieval Europe was the violence, often directed at Jews, who were accused of causing plague by poisoning wells.\n\nSince the eruption of the coronavirus, we have witnessed widespread anti-Asian discrimination and numerous acts of violence against Asians. We should learn from the past, identify these violent attacks as the scapegoating they are, and condemn them swiftly and harshly.",

    "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/article/flatten-curve-coronavirus.html",
    "article_text": "At the end of February, Drew Harris, a population health analyst at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, had just flown across the country to visit his daughter in Eugene, Ore., when he saw an article on his Google news feed. It was from The Economist, and was about limiting the damage of the coronavirus.\n\nThe accompanying art, by the visual-data journalist Rosamund Pearce, based on a graphic that had appeared in a C.D.C. paper titled “Community Mitigation Guidelines to Prevent Pandemic Influenza,” showed what Dr. Harris called two epi curves. One had a steep peak indicating a surge of coronavirus outbreak in the near term; the other had a flatter slope, indicating a more gradual rate of infection over a longer period of time.\n\nThe gentler curve results in fewer people infected at this critical moment in time — preventing a surge that would inundate the healthcare system and ultimately, one hopes, resulting in fewer deaths. “What we need to do is flatten that down,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, during the coronavirus task force briefing at the White House on a Tuesday evening in early March. “You do that with trying to interfere with the natural flow of the outbreak.”\n\nThe infographic reminded Dr. Harris of something similar that he had designed years earlier for a pandemic preparedness training program. “Folks in the preparedness and public health community have been thinking about all of these issues for many years,” Dr. Harris said in an email. “Understanding and managing surge is an important part of preparedness.” But during the training course, Dr. Harris’s students had struggled with the concept of reducing the epidemic curve, so he added a dotted line indicating hospital capacity — “to make clear what was at stake,” he said.",

    "article_text": "In the town of Rasht, a funeral procession for a doctor who died of coronavirus. In Qeshm, protesters block a checkpoint because they fear letting in clerics coming from an infected area. And in a cemetery in Qom, a burial is taking place. The man filming provides commentary. Qom is the city where Iran’s first coronavirus cases appeared. Though authorities expressed little concern for days, and now, it appears workers are digging trenches for mass graves. Iran says at least 237 people have died. It’s one of the highest death tolls outside of China. How did this happen? At key moments officials made serious missteps, and failed to take protective measures. On Feb. 19, the first coronavirus deaths are reported in Iran in the religious city of Qom. But victims likely contracted the virus weeks earlier, and in a city full of holy sites the visitors touch and kiss, that could have helped spread it. Iran’s health ministry did ask the city to close the shrines, but it was never enforced. So people continued to visit them. Two days after the deaths in Qom, Iran held nationwide parliamentary elections. But out at polling stations, there was little sign of a nation on the brink of an epidemic. No one was wearing gloves or masks, and there was lots of close contact. Officials tried in the days that followed to calm the public. But their efforts were undercut by bizarre appearances. Here’s Iran’s deputy health minister, Iraj Harirchi, on state TV saying things were under control. But throughout the presser, he was sweating, coughing and dismissing common-sense prevention methods. Harirchi went on TV a second time that day, making jokes about proper coughing protocol. But the next day, Harirchi announced on social media that he, himself, had contracted the virus. This shocking turn of events put Iran’s mismanagement of the epidemic on international display. “People in Iran are panicking.” “Well, now he’s become part of the story because he’s got the virus.” President Hassan Rouhani then tried to pin the spreading virus on Iran’s enemies. It took officials nine days after the first coronavirus death to cancel Friday prayers, where large groups typically gather. Meanwhile, high-profile cases started appearing. At least 23 lawmakers now have the virus. A vice president announces that she, too, has the coronavirus — just days prior, here she is sitting near President Rouhani. Then on March 1, a close aide of the supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, dies of coronavirus. Shortly after, the government ordered all schools and universities to shut down, and Khamenei tries to rewrite history. Iran is finally putting tougher measures in place. But by letting the virus get out of hand, officials turned their country into an epicenter.",

    "article_text": "From the U.S. to Ireland, from the U.K. to Australia and Taiwan, people are buying up insane amounts of toilet paper. I mean, look at this. What is going on with all this pandemic panic- buying? Coronavirus causes several symptoms, but diarrhea is not that common among them — at least not common enough to need a lot of this in a hurry. Do these people know something we don’t? Toilet paper, the ultimate quarantine essential, used since the days of the Black Death to ward off disease. It’s incredibly versatile. It makes a delicious meal. Face mask. A comfy pillow. Cozy scarf. Hot date. Fetching hat. No, coronavirus probably won’t make you soil your pants, but panic-buying kind of should. Consumers tend not to think about it, but buying more than our fair share of something means other people won’t get theirs. And that’s usually people on lower incomes who can’t afford to drop 100 bucks on a trolley full of triple ply. And the sight of empty shelves tricks other shoppers into panicking and the whole thing starts to spread like, well, you know. So look, realistically, you should stock up on some things just in case you and your family need to isolate yourselves in the near future. Canned dry and frozen foods are all good as well as drinks and of course, any medication. But you only need enough for a couple of weeks. That’s the general length of a coronavirus quarantine. Stockpile more and we might all find that sense of being in control is forever slipping out of our grasp.",

Hold on a second.” “I have prepared myself already, mentally, multiple times, to go back to Oregon and leave this entire beautiful dream behind me. So many people, including many of my friends, are working at bars, at restaurants, which are now closed. And now we’re all at home, wondering, Can we make it another month? Can our families afford to pay their mortgages at home? Do we just need to go back and start working, just so we can help our own families, the people that we love the most, stay in the homes that we grew up in? It’s hard to think that my mom or my dad are never going to see retirement. The best things that we can do right now as a community is just to give ourselves over to something that brings us true happiness. Because right now, it feels like it’s about to get very desperate.” “This is only something that we can get through if we’re working together. There will be so much suffering, unnecessary suffering, if we’re not really looking out for each other and if we only think about ourselves and our well-being. We have to be thinking about each other.” [Birds chirping]",

These are measures the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommended to slow a coronavirus outbreak in the United States.\n\nYet these are much easier to do for certain people — in particular, high-earning professionals. Service industry workers, like those in restaurants, retail, child care and the gig economy, are much less likely to have paid sick days, the ability to work remotely or employer-provided health insurance.\n\nThe disparity could make the new coronavirus, which causes a respiratory illness known as Covid-19, harder to contain in the United States than in other rich countries that have universal benefits like health care and sick leave, experts say. A large segment of workers are not able to stay home, and many of them work in jobs that include high contact with other people. It could also mean that low-income workers are hit harder by the virus.\n\n“Very quickly, it’s going to circulate a lot faster in the poorer communities than the wealthiest ones,” said Dr. James Hadler, Connecticut’s former state epidemiologist and now a consultant to the state. His work has found that influenza infections tend to strike low-income neighborhoods more aggressively than affluent ones, and that poor families are more likely to live in close quarters with others, and to share bathrooms.",

Its report estimated that a severe influenza pandemic would require mechanical ventilators for 740,000 critically ill people.\n\nToday, as the country faces the possibility of a widespread outbreak of a new respiratory infection caused by the coronavirus, there are nowhere near that many ventilators, and most are already in use. Only about 62,000 full-featured ventilators were in hospitals across the country, a 2010 study found. More than 10,000 others are stored in the Strategic National Stockpile, a federal cache of supplies and medicines held in case of emergencies, according to Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nTens of thousands of other respiratory devices could be repurposed in an emergency, experts say, but the shortfall could be stark, potentially forcing doctors to make excruciating life-or-death decisions about who would get such help should hospitals become flooded with the desperately sick.\n\nMuch about the coronavirus remains unclear, and it is far from certain that the outbreak will reach severe proportions in the United States or affect many regions at once. With its top-notch scientists, modern hospitals and sprawling public health infrastructure, most experts agree, the United States is among the countries best prepared to prevent or manage such an epidemic.",

Washington State, which has reported at least 10 deaths from the outbreak, has closed some schools, while on the other side of the country in New York, newly diagnosed cases have led to the closure of several schools as well.\n\nThe speed and scale of the educational tumult — which now affects 290.5 million students worldwide, the United Nations says — has little parallel in modern history, educators and economists contend. Schools provide structure and support for families, communities and entire economies. The effect of closing them for days, weeks and sometimes even months could have untold repercussions for children and societies at large.\n\n“They’re always saying, ‘When can we go out to play? When can we go to school?’” said Gao Mengxian, a security guard in Hong Kong whose two daughters have been stuck at home because school has been suspended since January.\n\nIn some countries, older students have missed crucial study sessions for college admissions exams, while younger ones have risked falling behind in reading and math. Parents have lost wages, tried to work at home or scrambled to find child care. Some have moved children to new schools in areas unaffected by the coronavirus, and lost milestones like graduation ceremonies or last days of school.\n\n“I don’t have data to offer, but can’t think of any instances in modern times where advanced economies shut down schools nationally for prolonged periods of time,” said Jacob Kirkegaard, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.",

One employee reported for duty at 10 p.m., learned that a colleague had fallen sick, and was out the door by 10:30 p.m., Mr. Jackson said.\n\nThose that stayed debated whether they should use their time now, or bank their sick days in case things become even worse. Mr. Jackson reasoned that since he is 34, healthy and lives alone, he could afford the risk. “We haven’t hit the peak yet so let’s work through this right now,” he said, reflecting the view of some of his colleagues.\n\nBut he said he felt like the nonessential parts of his job should be jettisoned to focus on delivering important goods and products. “We’re still sending brochures for cruise trips, thousands of them,” he said. “This doesn’t need to happen.”\n\nIn a message to postal employees last week, Megan J.

    "article_text": "[Machine beeping] “The frustrating thing about all of this is it really just feels like it’s too little, too late. Like we knew — we knew it was coming. Today is kind of getting worse and worse. We had to get a refrigerated truck to store the bodies of patients who are dying. We are, right now, scrambling to try to get a few additional ventilators or even CPAP machines. If we could get CPAP machines, we could free up ventilators for patients who need them. You know, we now have these five vents. We probably — unless people die, I suspect we’ll be back to needing to beg for ventilators again in another day or two. There’s a mythical 100 vents out there which we haven’t seen. Leaders in various offices, from the president to the head of Health and Hospitals, saying things like, ‘We’re going to be fine. Everything’s fine.’ And from our perspective, everything is not fine. I don’t have the support that I need, and even just the materials that I need, physically, to take care of my patients. And it’s America, and we’re supposed to be a first-world country. On a regular day, my emergency department’s volume is pretty high. It’s about 200 people a day. Now we’re seeing 400 or more people a day. At first, we were trying to isolate patients with cough and fever and be more careful around them, but we weren’t necessarily being extra careful around all the other patients. And then we started to realize that patients who were coming in with no fever but abdominal pain actually had findings on their X-rays and chest CTs that were consistent with this coronavirus, Covid-19. So someone in a car accident gets brought in and we get a CT scan of them, and their lungs look like they have coronavirus. We were seeing a lot of patients who probably had Covid, but we didn’t realize. Ten residents and also many, many of our nurses and a few of the attending physicians got sick. The anxiety of this situation is really overwhelming. All of the doctors, it’s hard for us to get tested even if we want to, even if we have symptoms. We’re exposed over and over again. We don’t have the protective equipment that we should have. I put on one N95 mask in the morning. I need to have that N95 mask on for every patient I see. I don’t take it off all day. The N95 mask I wore today is also the N95 mask I wore on Friday. We’re always worried that we’ll be out of N95 masks. What’s a little bit scary now is the patients that we’re getting are much sicker. Many of the young people who are getting sick don’t smoke, they’re healthy, they have no co-morbidities. They’re just young, regular people between the ages of 30 and 50 who you would not expect to get this sick. So many people are saying it’s going to be OK, everything’s fine, we have what we need. And if this goes on for a month or two or three or five like it did in China, and we’re already this strained, we don’t have what we need. I don’t really care if I get in trouble for speaking to the media. I want people to know that this is bad. People are dying. We don’t have the tools that we need in the emergency department and in the hospital to take care of them, and — and it’s really hard.”",

Each country — including the United States — should look into suspending their patents globally. After the crisis is over, intellectual property rights can be restored, and any firm that decides to stay in the industry should then be required to start paying normal patent license fees. Those Italian valve innovators said they had no intention of continuing in that business. They were just trying to help.\n\nTake a deep breath on privacy worries.\n\nThe strict “stay-in-place” rules that have been adopted around the world are imposing enormous economic and emotional costs. It is essential that we fight the spread of the virus as quickly as possible. Tragically, this process been severely handicapped by a shortage of tests in many places, including much of the United States. Now that testing is beginning at scale, a crucial step to speed the fight is to identify the network of people who have had contact with those who newly tested positive.\n\nOne expeditious way to accomplish this task is to give epidemiologists access to anonymized data that is being created by the GPS tracking on our smartphones. If companies can use this data to market services to you, shouldn’t health agencies use it to track the spread of this disease?\n\nOne example of how smartphone data could be taken another step forward comes from Singapore, which has been one of the most successful countries in fighting the coronavirus, deploying numerous tools including widespread testing. Lately authorities there have added a new tool to their arsenal. As reported by The Financial Times, the government started TraceTogether, an app that uses Bluetooth technology to record distance between users as well as the duration of their encounters. People consent to give the health ministry the information, which is encrypted and deleted after 21 days. The department can then contact users in case of “probable contact” with an infected individual.\n\nNote that this is a service people opt into. Both of us would gladly sign up. We don’t think anyone should be forced to use it, but we do think it should be legal.",

The consensus among experts is that 60 to 70 percent of the population will be infected.”\n\nThe heart of her message was that Germans should take precautions to ensure that the health system can handle the high number of people who could fall seriously ill. She urged people to stay at home as much as possible.\n\n“How we respond matters,” Ms. Merkel said. “We are playing for time.”\n\n“We are at the start of a development that we cannot yet see the end of,” she told reporters in her first public appearance to address the epidemic, which has already infected more than 1,600 people in Germany. “But we as a country will do whatever is necessary to do, working within the European bloc.”\n\nThat readiness includes flexibility on spending, especially to help the small and midsize enterprises that are losing business, she said.",

    "article_text": "This article was last updated on March 19, and is no longer being updated. This is a fast-moving situation, so some information may be outdated. For the latest updates, read The New York Times’s live coronavirus coverage here.\n\nThe new coronavirus is spreading rapidly throughout the world — and parents are increasingly on edge. More than 180,000 have been sickened worldwide, and more than 7,000 have died since an outbreak began in December in Wuhan, China. In the United States, cases have been rising rapidly as officials ramp up testing across the country.\n\nOn March 11, the World Health Organization announced that the spread of the coronavirus had officially become a pandemic. “Bottom line: It’s going to get worse,” Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, M.D., the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said that same day at a congressional hearing.\n\nAs the outbreak picks up steam, infectious disease experts in the United States, while not panicked, are expressing concern. “There’s a whole spectrum of opinions out there as to how worried we should be,” said Dr. H. Cody Meissner, M.D., chief of the division of pediatric infectious disease at Floating Hospital for Children at Tufts Medical Center and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ Committee on Infectious Diseases.\n\nHe noted that while there has not yet been as huge a surge of hospitalizations and deaths from the disease in the United States as there were in places like in China and Italy, “that doesn’t mean the tsunami that everyone says is coming won’t,” he added. “But as of right now, this seems primarily a disease of elderly patients who are frail, and who have other, coexisting health conditions such as heart or lung disease, or Type 2 diabetes.”",

Even with some time to prepare, administrators fear they will not be ready.\n\nStaffing shortages could hinder care if doctors and nurses become infected. There may not be enough ventilators or bed space for a crush of seriously ill patients.\n\n“Our hospitals are already stretched to capacity,” said C.

Andrew Cuomo of New York. The president made the statement in spite of government reports predicting shortages in a severe pandemic — and he reversed course on Friday morning, calling for urgent steps to produce more ventilators.\n\nSpeaking on Fox on Thursday, Mr. Trump suggested wrongly that because of his early travel restrictions on China, “a lot of the people decided to go to Italy instead” — though Italy had issued a more wide-ranging ban on travel from China and done so earlier than the United States. And at a White House briefing on Friday, he wrongly said he was the “first one” to impose restrictions on China. North Korea, for one, imposed restrictions 10 days before the United States.\n\nHe misleadingly claimed again on Friday that “we’ve tested now more than anybody.” In terms of raw numbers, the United States has tested more people for the coronavirus than Italy and South Korea but still lags behind in tests per capita.",

An energetic young medical student with dark, penetrating eyes, Mr. Abri and a small team visited one such village at dusk last week. There were 20 or so tents sheltering 50 people, with cooking stoves, backpacks, plastic folding chairs and butane canisters strewn about.\n\n“If someone comes down with respiratory symptoms,” Mr. Abri asked us, “how can they quarantine themselves?”\n\nMany homeless people don’t go to doctors — they have no insurance or transportation — and doctors virtually never go to them. While medical authorities have urged people to keep a distance from one another to limit the spread of Covid-19, Mr. Abri said that can be hard for him on his visits to encampments for the homeless.\n\n“It feels strange, almost wrong, not to look them in the eye and touch them,” he said. “Are we supposed to bump elbows with the very people our public systems have abandoned? My first job is to regain their trust, to treat them with dignity.”",

He’s a mathematician at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, and he uses math to understand outbreaks of diseases like Ebola, SARS, influenza and now Covid-19. His goal is to design better ways to control outbreaks.\n\nIn an eerie coincidence, he wrote a book called “The Rules of Contagion,” before the current outbreak, which has been published in Britain and will be released in September in the United States. In it he talks about the math of contagion involving not only physical diseases, but also ideas, rumors and even financial crises.\n\nIn a recent experiment for the 100th anniversary of the 1918 flu, he worked with another mathematician and BBC presenter, Hannah Fry, of University College London, and collaborators at the University of Cambridge, to create a documentary, “Contagion: The BBC Four Pandemic,” using a phone app to track social contacts and map how an infection might spread.\n\nThe news of coronavirus epidemics around the world involves a flood of numbers that are a challenge for any nonscientist to digest. I asked Dr. Kucharski to help us navigate some of these numbers, and to tell us which ones we should pay attention to. We talked on the phone and corresponded by email this week.

How will this affect my city and those who may have come into contact with me? For a moment, the uncertainty felt crippling.\n\nMy wife and children went to stay with family, while I hunkered down in our home. I speak with them daily through FaceTime, but I can’t hug or kiss them. The hardest part is not being able to be with them during these uncertain times. Fortunately, I have experienced little to no symptoms.\n\nThe challenge has now become how to lead the city remotely and ensure that the wheels of government keep turning. My duties typically involve lots of physical interactions with city residents. With that no longer possible, the dynamic of my job has changed immensely, requiring my staff and me to be creative in how we work.\n\nThe coronavirus has paralyzed the world in a way most of us have never seen in our lifetime. It’s chilling. We’re learning how to practice social distance, to self-quarantine, to interact remotely. It’s just not something we’re used to.",

It felt like a stab to my chest. I’m Chinese-American, and this is someone that I’ve gone to school with for almost three years, who I consider a friend. But it’s no wonder that she feels this way. “An obscure virus arising from a meat market in eastern China.” As the Coronavirus spreads, there’s another virus spreading that we need to be talking about. “A woman who’s Asian says she was punched by another woman in midtown Manhattan and she accused her of having the Covid-19 virus.” “I don’t want him [inaudible] me. Tell him to move.” Young Asian-Americans like me are feeling hate infect every part of our lives. “And I’d like to just ask the Chinese for a formal apology.” Not only do we have to be afraid about our health. But we have to be afraid about being ourselves. Class basically just started. One of the girls said all Chinese people were disgusting. And so I literally like raised my hand up and was like “I’m Chinese.” She didn’t even say sorry. She didn’t. She just like blew past it I guess. And then she like kept going on about it. I never knew it would happen to me, especially at this school. Good morning. Morning. Yeah, basically this Chinese restaurant was like texting their customers saying none of our staff have been to China. We have no contact with the Coronavirus. Please like like, come back to us. And people were like making fun of it. There are thousands and thousands of cases in Italy. But no one’s boycotting Olive Garden. No seriously like, no one is boycotting a mom and pop’s pizza place. Like it’s the same thing. Historically, pandemics have stoked xenophobia. In the 19th century, people spread rumors that Irish immigrants carried cholera, and tuberculosis was known as the “Jewish disease.” In 1900, when a Chinese man supposedly died of the plague in San Francisco, Chinatown residents were forcibly quarantined by police, while white residents were allowed to leave the area. It seems like since the start of the Coronavirus outbreak schools have been a Petri dish for racism. It’s dangerous to normalize behavior like this for people my age. So you just spoke with the other student. So can you tell me what happened? She understood my frustration and anger. They didn’t really mean to say that. And they were actually making a generalization. And so she apologized to me basically. And I really appreciated it. Coronavirus may have originated in China. But the disease doesn’t discriminate in the way that people do. It’s extremely important that people have accurate information on how to stay safe. So we can kill this virus without spreading another one.",

    "article_text": "A mother who was infected with the coronavirus couldn’t smell her baby’s full diaper. Cooks who can usually name every spice in a restaurant dish can’t smell curry or garlic, and food tastes bland. Others say they can’t pick up the sweet scent of shampoo or the foul odor of kitty litter.\n\nAnosmia, the loss of sense of smell, and ageusia, an accompanying diminished sense of taste, have emerged as peculiar telltale signs of Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and possible markers of infection.\n\nOn Friday, British ear, nose and throat doctors, citing reports from colleagues around the world, called on adults who lose their senses of smell to isolate themselves for seven days, even if they have no other symptoms, to slow the disease’s spread. The published data is limited, but doctors are concerned enough to raise warnings.\n\n“We really want to raise awareness that this is a sign of infection and that anyone who develops loss of sense of smell should self-isolate,” Prof. Claire Hopkins, president of the British Rhinological Society, wrote in an email. “It could contribute to slowing transmission and save lives.”",

    "article_text": "The abrupt end of the dispute underscored the frantic search for more hospital beds as cities try to prepare for a crisis that is overwhelming medical facilities in New York, and highlighted the tensions between government officials and businesses in responding to the pandemic. This week, the Trump administration backed away from announcing a $1 billion deal with General Motors and Ventec Life Systems to produce ventilators, after officials said they needed more time to assess the estimated cost.\n\nIn Philadelphia, coronavirus infections are quickly rising. On Friday, the city health commissioner, Dr. Thomas Farley, reported 154 new cases, for a total of 637 cases across every ZIP code of the city, and three deaths. “This virus is everywhere in Philadelphia,” he said.\n\nThe owner of the hospital, Joel Freedman of Broad Street Healthcare Properties, a real estate company, said he had offered to sell the facility to the city well below market price, or to lease it for $60 a bed a day, far less than what two other hospitals in California agreed to charge to lease their facilities.\n\n“Anyone looking at the apples-to-apples comparison can see that Mr. Freedman not only desired to be helpful to the city of Philadelphia and its leaders, but he was very reasonable,” said Sam Singer, a spokesman for Mr. Freedman, who is based in Los Angeles. “We’re disappointed that they didn’t accept what we offered, but we stand ready to be helpful to the city or the state if they want to reopen discussions.”\n\nHahnemann Hospital, which once served the city’s poorest patients, closed in September 2019.

    "article_text": "Donald Trump rose to power with the determined assistance of a movement that denies science, bashes government and prioritized loyalty over professional expertise. In the current crisis, we are all reaping what that movement has sown.\n\nAt least since the 19th century, when the proslavery theologian Robert Lewis Dabney attacked the physical sciences as “theories of unbelief,” hostility to science has characterized the more extreme forms of religious nationalism in the United States. Today, the hard core of climate deniers is concentrated among people who identify as religiously conservative Republicans. And some leaders of the Christian nationalist movement, like those allied with the Cornwall Alliance for the Stewardship of Creation, which has denounced environmental science as a “Cult of the Green Dragon,” cast environmentalism as an alternative — and false — theology.\n\nThis denial of science and critical thinking among religious ultraconservatives now haunts the American response to the coronavirus crisis. On March 15, Guillermo Maldonado, who calls himself an “apostle” and hosted Mr. Trump earlier this year at a campaign event at his Miami megachurch, urged his congregants to show up for worship services in person. “Do you believe God would bring his people to his house to be contagious with the virus? Of course not,” he said.\n\nRodney Howard-Browne of The River at Tampa Bay Church in Florida mocked people concerned about the disease as “pansies” and insisted he would only shutter the doors to his packed church “when the rapture is taking place.” In a sermon that was live-streamed on Facebook, Tony Spell, a pastor in Louisiana, said, “We’re also going to pass out anointed handkerchiefs to people who may have a fear, who may have a sickness and we believe that when those anointed handkerchiefs go, that healing virtue is going to go on them as well.”",

    "article_text": "Three scenarios for how the outbreak could spread. Percent infected by 25 50 75% No control measures Some control measures Severe control measures Three scenarios for how the outbreak could spread. Percent infected by 25 50 75%\n\nThe coronavirus has infected far more people in the United States than testing has shown so far, and stringent measures to limit social contact in parts of the country not yet seeing many cases are needed to significantly stem the tide of illness and death in the coming months.\n\nThose are the conclusions of Columbia University researchers who used a New York Times database of known cases and Census Bureau transportation data to model how the outbreak could evolve based on what is known about the virus. The estimates are inherently uncertain, and they could change as America adopts unprecedented measures to control the outbreak.\n\nBut they offer a stark warning: Even if the country cut its rate of transmission in half — a tall order — some 650,000 people might become infected in the next two months.\n\nThe growth is driven by Americans with mild symptoms who are carrying and spreading the virus without being aware that they have it, the researchers say. The number of undetected cases — 11 times more than has been officially reported, they estimate — reflects how far behind the United States has fallen in testing for the virus.\n\nNew York City, Seattle, Boston and parts of California already have such large outbreaks that they will probably see significant growth even after taking extraordinary measures over the past week, the researchers say. New York City’s outbreak, the nation’s largest, grew to more than 4,000 known cases on Friday and is likely to increase many times over even in a favorable scenario.\n\nHow Control Measures Could Slow the Outbreak New cases per day No control measures 500K 400K Some control measures 300K 200K The U.S. is now reporting thousands of cases per day. 100K Severe control measures 2/21 3/22 4/21 5/21 6/20 7/20 New cases per day No control measures 500K 400K Some control measures 300K 200K The U.S. is now reporting thousands of cases per day. 100K Severe control measures Feb. 21 March 22 April 21 May 21 June 20 July 20 By The New York Times · Source: Sen Pei and Jeffrey Shaman, Columbia University\n\nOn the other hand, parts of the country without large clusters of cases could still avoid the worst of the outbreak — if they impose measures like closing schools, banning mass gatherings and testing and quarantining sick people and their contacts. The epidemic would then spread inland at a much slower pace and strike with less severity, the estimates say.\n\nBut controls would need to be put in place immediately, and everywhere.\n\n“We’re looking at something that’s catastrophic on a level that we have not seen for an infectious disease since 1918,” said Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia and the leader of the research team, referring to the Spanish flu. “And it’s requiring sacrifices we haven’t seen since World War II. There are going to be enormous disruptions. There’s no easy way out.”\n\nWhere the outbreak could spread Total new infections by day Total: 10 100 1,000 No intervention Without control measures, the outbreak might sweep across most of the country by early May.

Severe control measures The outbreak could be limited in areas that do not now have large numbers of known cases. Severe control measures The outbreak could be limited in areas that do not now have large numbers of known cases. By The New York Times\n\nControls in many places have already changed the fabric of American life. Restaurants and schools have closed, people are working from home and travelers have put off trips — all changes that should reduce the rate of infection. In California, New York and Illinois, officials have announced more stringent directives aimed at stopping the spread. That means that at least 1 in 5 Americans will be under orders to stay home in the coming days, and more states are expected to follow suit.\n\nBut other places have resisted. Bars and restaurants remain open in Wichita, Kan., in a county that reported its first case on Thursday night, and in Knoxville, Tenn., where reports of the virus have been scarce. Some malls remain open in Chicago, recreational marijuana shops in Oregon, and some retail chains nationwide. Many businesses are still requiring workers to come into the office.\n\n“I’m not really supportive yet of restricting things further or closing down,” said Pete Meitzner, head of the Board of County Commissioners in Sedgwick County, which includes Wichita, a city of about 400,000. Mr. Meitzner said he was growing increasingly anxious at the possibility that people who do not know they are ill might spread the virus, but that he also needed to consider the fate of workers as the community decided whether to close buildings.\n\n“Some of our public offices and buildings are, but I do feel horrible for our restaurant workers and our hospitality workers at our hotels,” he said. “They are really suffering.”\n\nOf the area’s relative dearth of cases, Mr. Meitzner added, “We don’t know for sure if we’re lucky or what.”\n\nThe scenarios do not estimate what effect individual local actions will have on the outbreak. But if the country as a whole does not take collective action, they suggest that Sedgwick County could see a significant proportion of its population — hundreds of thousands of people — infected with the virus in the next two months. If the country, as a whole, can reduce rates of transmission by 50 percent, Sedgwick County could instead see fewer than 1,000 cases in that time.\n\nThe rate of new infections varies by state New cases per capita by day, sorted by peak time By The New York Times · Source: Sen Pei and Jeffrey Shaman, Columbia University\n\nSeveral researchers not involved in the Columbia University analysis who reviewed the findings said they made sense and broadly agreed with their own thinking. Even in places that now appear to have few cases, they said, officials should act sooner rather than later.\n\n“You have to think of this as an insurance for the future: The earlier you do it, the greater effect you have on the virus,” said Alessandro Vespignani, director of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University, who said the estimates were in line with his own projections. “It’s better to take excessive precautions than not.”\n\nThe economic challenges of that loom.\n\n“We’re staying open until someone forces us to shut down,” Beau McKee, the general manager at Not Watson’s Kitchen and Bar in Knoxville, said in a telephone interview, as dishes clattered in the background. “I feel like those people that are vulnerable know who they are and they should be careful, and we should continue testing. But small businesses are getting crushed.”\n\nMr. McKee said he has grown increasingly worried about how the virus could affect his own father, in his 70s, but that there were other worries too. “At least we can offer a handful of people good-paying jobs and when we get out of this and we’re on the other side, we’ll hopefully have gained more clientele by doing so because we kind of stuck it out and didn’t wave the white flag,” he said.\n\nThe Columbia researchers’ model works by observing the behavior of the outbreak in the United States up until March 13, based on case records compiled by The New York Times, commuting patterns and other data.\n\nThe researchers use those observations to infer key features of the outbreak. One is how many people each infected person has tended to infect so far, about 2.2. Another is how many people may pass on the virus without knowing that they have it. The disease is spreading far too fast to be explained by known cases alone, and only about 1 in 11 infections have been reported, they found.\n\nThose factors allow the researchers to simulate the spread of a virus in the future. They adjust those simulations under different scenarios in which the nation imposes a range of control measures to stop the spread.\n\nThe estimates are imperfect, but they are consistent with the available data. It is impossible to know the exact number of cases a week ago or to predict the future. It is also impossible to model the precise impact of unprecedented measures that America has already put in place to control the outbreak.\n\nBut the research estimates that if measures to slow the disease are not effective, the virus could sicken millions of people or more, losing steam on the coasts in May before spreading to the rest of the country over the summer.\n\nA worst-case scenario is unlikely to play out. A handful of countries, including China and South Korea, have managed to slow down their own fast-moving outbreaks through tracking and isolating sick people and reducing social contact. It is not known if measures imposed in the last week have started slowing the outbreak in the United States.\n\nBut the researchers’ estimates show the enormity of the task. As in China, most of those who have been infected but not tested are likely to have mild symptoms, or none at all, the researchers say. That means they can spread the virus without being aware they are infected.\n\nSeveral researchers said that the slow pace of testing in the United States is one major reason the proportion of unreported infections is so high here. Despite a ramping up of testing in recent days, the United States still lags both Italy and South Korea in the total number of people tested and in testing per-capita, figures show.\n\nThis map shows how many people the model estimates could get the virus in each county in the United States by two months from now.\n\nOne scenario — which is unlikely — simulates what could happen without any intervention. A second scenario envisions what would happen with some control measures, such as partial adherance to social distancing guidlines and a patchwork of government-imposed restrictions on work, travel, and dining out. A third envisions severe control measures: strict adherance across the country to social distancing, working remotely, closing schools and restaurants and banning large gatherings.\n\nThree scenarios for each county These are rough estimates of how the virus could spread, but they are inherently uncertain, especially many months in the future. Projections are based on case reports as of March 13. No transmission reduction Some control measures Severe control measures No transmission reduction Some control measures Severe control measures + - Estimated infection rate 5 25 50 75% + - By The New York Times · Source: Sen Pei and Jeffrey Shaman, Columbia University\n\nNew York City, the model indicates, could count tens of thousands of new cases every day by late spring or early summer. But if the city remains vigilant about maintaining the stringent measures recently put in place, the peak could be delayed by weeks or longer and be significantly lower, the model suggests. Dr. Shaman cautioned that the model is designed to capture national trends, and local projections should be viewed as broad estimates.\n\n“This is serious and this is real. We have to act now and act aggressive,” Dr. Vespignani said. “We have to mobilize all the resources that we have. None of us has a single solution. But we have to try all of them.”\n\nIn the days since New York’s first recorded case, on March 1, the state has declared a state of emergency and deployed the National Guard to New Rochelle, an early focal point of the outbreak; New York City has closed schools and barred dining in at restaurants and watching Broadway shows.\n\nBut in places like Wichita, some parts of life have yet to change. In that city, bars and restaurants are allowed to operate freely as long as they keep crowds to fewer than 50 people.\n\nStill, Beverly Salas, an owner of Egg Cetera, a downtown restaurant that serves brunch and late-night bites for the bar crowd, said she chose to close the restaurant anyway. “It was a hard decision, honestly, because we have no more income coming in,” Ms. Salas, 24, said. But her customers include nurses from a nearby hospital and many people who are in their 60s or older, she said, and the thought that someone might somehow contract the illness at her small restaurant was too much for her to bear.\n\n“I’m looking at other places like Italy and trying to avoid going through that,” she said. “Why are we not taking it as seriously as New York, Chicago, or even Kansas City? I know we’re a smaller town, but there are cases all over the country.”",

    "article_text": "Mr. President, very simple question. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your response to this crisis? [FLASHBACK SOUND EFFECT] The risk to the American people remains very low. This is an unprecedented potential severe health challenge. It’ll go away. Goes away. It’s going. away. We will see more cases and things will get worse than they are right now. In April, supposedly, it dies with the hotter weather. This virus is probably with us beyond this season, or beyond this year. This is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. Have you been briefed by the CDC? I have. Are there words about a pandemic at this point? No, not at all, and we have it totally under control. When you have 15 people and the 15, within a couple of days, is going to be down to close to zero. And we can expect to see more cases in the United States. We will see more cases. Unfortunately, we are likely to see more deaths. I like the numbers being where they are. I don’t need to have the numbers double. We’ll certainly have tens of thousands of cases in the US. Hopefully, we won’t hit hundreds of thousands of cases. We’d much rather be ahead of the curve than behind it, and that’s what we are. You are always behind where you think you are. If you think you’re here, you’re really here. Anybody that wants a test can get a test. Not everybody, tomorrow, is going to be able to get a test. Anybody that needs a test. That’s the important thing. And the tests are all perfect. The idea of anybody getting it easily, the way people in other country are doing it, we’re not set up for that. That is a failing. A failing? Yes. It is a failing, let’s admit it. Dr. Fauci said that the lag in testing was in fact a failing. Do you take responsibility for that? Yeah. No, I don’t take responsibility at all. They’re gonna have vaccines, I think, relatively soon. And they’re going to have— [CHEERING] something that makes you better. It would take them about a year to a year and a half to be fully confident that we would have a vaccine that would be able to protect the American people. I mean, I like the sound of a couple of months better, I must be honest. Is it safe or appropriate to be holding rallies during a public health crisis like this? I think it’s very safe. Yeah. You probably shouldn’t get on planes. You shouldn’t go into areas, large malls, large areas where people are congregating because it’s too high a risk. Getting away from shaking hands is a good thing. Maybe people shouldn’t be shaking hands for the long term because it does transmit flu and other things. I’m working on getting the boss to do this. I may not be successful, but we’re working on it. In terms of deaths, I don’t what the count is today. Is it 11? 11 people. What is the number as of this morning? Is it 32? You could tell me, is it 32 deaths, Steve? Unfortunately, one person passed away overnight. She was a wonderful woman, a medically high-risk patient in her late 50s. And on a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your response to this crisis? I’d rate it a 10. I think we’ve done a great job.",

    "article_text": "Officials in King County said that 15 more residents of Life Care had been taken to hospitals over the past day. Dow Constantine, the King County executive, said officials were working to help families who want to remove residents from Life Care and take them home with the necessary medical equipment.\n\n“For the families who say they are not being adequately communicated with, we hear you,” Mr. Constantine said. “We want to make sure everyone has the information and support they need in this time of crisis.”\n\nBecause the virus can poses a significant threat to people who are older or have underlying health problems, local public health officials in the Seattle area have encouraged people 60 and older to stay home. Everyone in the county has been encouraged to telecommute rather than go to work.\n\nFriday brought another round of restrictions around the area. The University of Washington, with 50,000 students, announced that it would move to remote learning. Emerald City Comic Con, a convention that draws tens of thousands of people each year, announced that it would postpone until the summer a gathering that was scheduled for next week. The chief federal judge in Seattle ordered the cancellation of all in-person federal court hearings in the western part of the state.\n\nStarbucks said it shut down its store near the downtown Seattle Art Museum after learning Thursday night that an employee had received a diagnosis of coronavirus. The company said it closed the store for a “deep clean” but hoped to have the site open again soon.",
